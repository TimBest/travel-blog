I awoke feeling fatigued and concluded that I was traveled out. So I ate a bowl of cereal and decided to take the morning off to relax, catch up on some TV, and then met up with Katie in the afternoon. 

Feeling more energetic and quite hungry I ventured out. I met Katie at a tailor's looking at some fabrics. She really wanted to get something custom made but non of the fabrics were right for her.

So we headed off to grab some food before being interrupted. First, by a shop owner that Katherine had befriended and he took us on a tour of the new building he was moving his shop into. Which was still very actively being built. With sparks flying this way and that!

Then secondly, when passing a well-rated tailor for men's suits. We popped in to look for a suit for me!

### meeting up with Katie

- Katie went out into Hoian to check out the tailors that she had researched
- In the evening I went out to meet up with her
- I met her at one of the tailors
- She introduced me to the Pakistani(?) shop owner of the store with the beautiful rug we saw yesterday
- he showed us the new shop he was building
- we walked around a very active construction site with sparks from some folks welding
- we walked into one tailor to look for a suit for me.
- I asked for purple fabric and they only had one very shiny fabric
  - purple is my favorite color
  - and I figured I could always get a grey/blue/black suit in the states
  - but would never get a custom-tailored purple suit
  - so why not take advantage of the opportunity

### dinner

- striking out on getting tailored clothes we walked along the Thu BÃµn River and stopped at [The Hoianian- wine bar & restaurant ](https://goo.gl/maps/2r5LYtRQ9ZJFH6oq7) for dinner
  - we sat inside on the upper floor but before we got our food one of the tables on the balcony freed up and we were able to sit there
  - it was a beautiful view with a long arm of red lanterns starting from our balcony outstretched over the street

### Kimmy's take 1

- After dinner on our walk back, we passed Kimmy Tailor (around 7 pm)
- Kimmy's was one of the top tailors Katie had researched so we decided to pop in for a "quick look"
- We asked about the purple fabric
- And one of the tailors was like "of course, we have many purple fabrics. Let's go to the warehouse"
- we walked out of the store, down the block, and turned on a tiny ally to a completely unmarked freight entrance
- she opened the door and inside was a huge space with floor-to-ceiling bolts of fabric
- We then spent the next two hours looking through fabrics
- we went through the purples and found one that I liked and look classy
- before going to the warehouse I saw a green suit that looked cool
- Katie convinced me to ask about the green fabrics as well
- they didn't have the same color as the display but we did find one I liked
- after selecting the two suit fabrics we went back to the showroom and looked at the liners
  the "recommended" silk liners were all too dated styles then I wanted
- I had been dreaming of getting a tailored suit since watching the Vietnam top gear special in College
- I wanted a liner that popped
- the tailors really wanted us to select a silk liner but I insisted on seeing the cotton fabric book which had a wider range of fabrics
- they warned me that it would wear out sooner. I didn't care figuring if I wore the suit enough for the liner to fail I will have gotten my money's worth :D
- I picked a number of contenders.
- I was torn from a suit that I would enjoy and was stylish vs living my top gear fancy and having the most obnoxious liner possible
  in the end, I decided on a liner for the purple that popped but was a bit more elegant and a liner for the green suit that was a bit more fun and popped
- after picking the fabrics we then looked at an Ipad with 2 dozen different suit patterns.
- I easily narrowed it down to about5 patterns knowing that I wanted a slim-cut single-breasted jacket. but between those cut, it was very difficult to find the right one
- we eventually settled on one after viewing a few of them on the showroom floor
- all in all the process took about 2 hours and after leaving a deposit I left with an appointment for my first fitting tomorrow at 1 pm

### ceramics store

- one the way back we stopped in a super cute ceramics store that I wanted to checkout the first day
- we bought two bowels we liked as souvenirs and so we could eat cereal in something other than our emergancy Tupperware that we purchased in Cambodia during our extension
- we found out the store opened in ???
- the owner was super nice

## 9/6

- we woke up and chatted with Stewart and Grace about traveling to Seoul
  - we chatted about Eddie and our travels so far
  - I told them I was feeling a little under the weather
  - we assured them we were down to travel with the newborn if they were willing
- I was convinced I had a cold
- Katie was instant that I test for COVID
- I didn't want to since my symptoms didn't seem consistent with the disease
- I tested positive for COVID-19 the first positive was super super faint so I did a second test to confirm and instantly as the sample ran through the test the second line showed up super bold
  Katie was still testing negative so she went to reception and got a second room

- zooming from separate rooms in the same hotel
- dropping off food at my door
- putting my trash and sheets outside my door and the staff dropping off fresh ones
- ordering food via Grab
  having a low-grade fever
  thankfully the room I was in had AC and a balcony
- missing out on the mid-august harvest and moon festival
- watching from my balcony and hearing the excitement
- super bummed because we had planned our month around this day
- and had rushed out of northern Vietnam to make sure we were here
- had to cancel our food-making class
  I downplayed my symptoms to Katie so she would still do the cave tour and stop at hue
- I knew I would be fine quarantining on my own and there was
