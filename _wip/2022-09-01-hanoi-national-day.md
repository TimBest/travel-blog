## National Day

I had very high hopes for National day. The Lonely Planet guidebook we were using, talked about a similar level of celebration as with the 4th of July in the States. And they emphasized that if you are going to be in Vietnam for it Hoian was the city to be in. For this reason, we decided to fly all the way to Hoian and travel the country from north to south. Even though our Ho chi min city was closer and our flight to Hoian connected through.

Since arriving in the city we had been asking around about the national day celebration. And had been getting many mixed signals. Some folks told us that National day is a holiday spent with your family and because of that most people won't be in the city they are in the country celebrating. Others mentioned that due to COVID the celebrations would be less/nonexistent. On others still, mentioned that there would still be fireworks and celebrations down by the lake.

That morning we got up and met another couple staying down the hall from us who we had met at breakfast. We walked around the city

- ho chi min plaza
- botanical garden
- tofu street vendor
  chat outside the convenience store
- ban mi
