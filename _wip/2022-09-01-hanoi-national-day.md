## National Day

I had very high hopes for National day. The Lonely Planet guidebook we were using, talked about a similar level of celebration as with the 4th of July in the States. And they emphasized that if you are going to be in Vietnam for it Hoian was the city to be in. For this reason, we decided to fly all the way to Hoian and travel the country from north to south. Even though our Ho chi min city was closer and our flight to Hoian connected through.

Since arriving in the city we had been asking around about the national day celebration. And had been getting many mixed signals. Some folks told us that National day is a holiday spent with your family and because of that most people won't be in the city they are in the country celebrating. Others mentioned that due to COVID the celebrations would be less/nonexistent. On others still, mentioned that there would still be fireworks and celebrations down by the lake.

That morning we got up and met another couple staying down the hall from us who we had met at breakfast and walked around the city

### Street Murals

After passing through lantern street we made our first stop along the way to look at street Murals in Hàng Mã. While still morning it was blistering hot. We were profusely sweating and carefully plotting our course to walk in as much shade as possible.

### Ho Chi Minh Mausoleum

I don't know what we were expecting but visiting the mausoleum was unpleasant. To get into the plaza we had to go through TSA-level security screening. Which was fine. Once through, the plaza was in full sun and we baked. I could feel my skin burning from both the sun hitting it directly and from the indirect radiant heating of the concrete. The kind of heat where the bottom of your nose gets sunburnt. Overall, the plaza was a bit much and we headed off to the a cooler place filled with more plants
