### general things

- the external door the zodiac door makes a huge bang when it opens
- the alcohol has very generous pours
- we are eating so many more deserts and red meat
- every day is so full between excursions, lectures, landings, eating, etc.
- it is really hard to balance going to the lecture or enjoying the scenery
- we chatted with one of the crew about his favorite spots
  - he said the Artic is better for wildlife (bears, foxes, whales, etc)
  - and the Antarctic is better for landscape
- every night there is a debrief where they go over the plan for tomorrow (which is also posted to their portal)
  - every day the plan changes due to the weather, ocean conditions, or marine life sightings
  - the change is nice as it forces everyone to be flexible and present with their schedule and planning
- we wake up to bud on the load speaker at 7 am telling us where we are, the condition, and the plan for the day
  - we then open our blinds to the most amazing view
  - it is the best alarm ever
  - each day the view is so different and so spectacular
- we didn't pay for the internet which is really nice to help us stay present
  - especially given how full the days are it is nice not to have other distractions
    without the internet, we can still access the portal and whats app - which is nice to chat with my parents and Jae&John
- the slippers I got in Punta Aranes were so perfect for the boat
- being out on the deck for whale watching I lost feeling in my trigger finger 3 or 4 times
- every time there was an animal sighting we would head to the 5/6 th floor observation deck and start to recognize the others who showed us. Katie dubbed us the 5th-floor observation deck crew

### fun facts

- ice
  - on lands its a glacier
  - in the water its an iceberg
  - small ice burgs are called growlers
    if it's small enough to pick up its called brash

### transfer to the Oriental hotel (1/28)

- Tim got a haircut
  - was only going to get the edges cleaned up and the mullet in the back removed
  - my lack of Spanish was hard
  - ended up with a very Chilain three-finger cut
- watched a beautiful sunset from our room
- the ship doctor is doctor sugarmen but sadly there was no relationship to magistra sugarmen

### Departure (1/29)

### The Drake Shake (1/30)

- we broke out the penguin suits and went up to the bridge with them
- It was super fun getting oriented on the boat and taking photos of seabirds
- the 3rd and 4 forth floor windows were boarded up for the crossing
- the 5 and 6 floor observation decks were closed for passenger safety (rumor has it someone died being out on a deck during the passage)

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images/2023-01-31-antarctica/1-drake-shake" %}

### Barrientos Island (1/31)

- we had lunch with the redhead girl, her mother and Massimo
  - we were sharing our travels
  - we mentioned that we had now been on all 7 continents and so had the girl
  - Massimo "corrected us" and was like 'well that was only an island you need to touch the mainland for it to count
  - she was completely defeated as her smile deflated
  - we jumped in saying it still counts

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images/2023-01-31-antarctica/2-barrientos-island" %}

### Tay head joinville island (1/31)

- had Massimo take a photo of us with the true south flag
  - we weren't sure if it was right side up or not
- we did a two-mile hike around the fur seals
- we saw 2 Weddell seals in the water at the furthest vista
- the Skuas were very interested in us and would often fly right above our heads
- Massimo told us not to touch the bones because they have anthrax
  - later sean pilled up a penguin skull to rearrange it for a better leading lines photo

### Tabular icebergs (2/1)

- the largest one we cruised by was 4 nautical miles/ 8 kilometers/5miles long
- Katie sipped dinner to go up and draw
- they were really challenging to draw as the ship was going so fast that every few seconds the entire shape of the iceberg had changed

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images/2023-01-31-antarctica/3.1-tabular-icebergs" %}

### Kayaking (2/2)

- they set up a really efficient system
  - a platform was hung a few inches below the surface between two zodiacs
  - you climb over the first zodiac and slide off the edge onto the kayak where staff are standing to keep it stable
    Katie and I were struggling to balance the desire to record the experience and be present in it
- there was a thin layer of ice in a number of places that we got to kayak through and listen to the crunch
- there were three safety zodiacs running this way and that to make sure everyone was safe and stayed away from the icebergs and glaciers to avoid injury from calving
- we ended up being delinquent and stayed out in the kayaks for both the first group and the second group
  - skipping the walk around the shore to the waterfall

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images/2023-01-31-antarctica/4-kayaking" %}

### Polar Plunge (2/2)

- toes went numb instantly
- Boonie tried to swim to the other zodiac and the dry suit guy had to jump in and pull her back
- standing in line was worse than the dip. the breeze every time they opened the door was freezing
- took a shot of patron with liz?&Kevin? after
- 4 of us sat in the hot tub then the sauna
  had a buffet-style lunch on the top deck

### The most magnificent sunset (2/2)

- the purple icebergs
- red sea
- watched from our balcony
- T went to the bridge afterward and the captain, navigator and night shift guy was there
- the captain seemed a bit tense managing all of them and avoiding the ice

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images/2023-01-31-antarctica/4.1-sunset" %}

### landing at snow hill and the historic hut (2/3)

- sculpture garden icebergs on the beach
- in precovid times Linblad let the researchers onto the ship for a shower and hot meal
  - this time they left them 2 cases of wine

  - for the artic cruises, they would invite the Inuit populations aboard, allowing them to bring their family's to enjoy the amenities
- the red-headed girl swapped hats with the argentine scientists
  - he signed his buff and left it on a rock halfway between
  - she picked it up and left her hat
  - we weren't allowed to approach them due to covid concerns
- had lunch with just in
  - he was the guide for the hut
  - he said he felt funny talking about it to the guest because the leading expert on the hut was one of the Argentines outside in the tents
  - Katie and him both lived in the presidio and chatted about that
- they had to move the boat further away when we were ashore to avoid a drifting iceberg
- I was ecstatic to finally get a door for the gram that wasn't on the boat

### the blue whale (2/3)

- spent an hour cruising alongside a blue whale and its baby
- we were in the lecture and they announced the sitting right as it ended
- we all rushed outside with our cameras and no coats the temperature was 2C and wind speeds from 38 to 50 Knotts
- we shot from the aft. when the whale moved to the bow. I ran to the room to get my coat
- ran out on deck 5 and the up to the 6 th floor observation deck
- Katie ran back to get my gloves

### gentoo penguins at mikkelson harbor at the south end of trinity island (2/4)

- Gentoo's had stone nests
- the chicks were late in the season and they might not survive to adulthood
- the penguins were going in and out of the wake which was cool to watch
- we couldn't land on the beech due to the penguins so we had to ram the zodiac up on a large rock and jump off the front
- the ground was covered in mud, poop, and regurgitated fish
- Whale bones and whaling boats on the beech
- watching the chicks sit beneath their moms
- the smell of the island stayed on our coats
- we had to triple-wash our pants and boats when were back on the boat
- there were a couple of Weddell seals
- the landscape behind the island, with the glacier and the mountain's stuff
- as I was boarding the zodiac I ran into Massimo and he mentioned that I still haven't been on the continent because we were on an island
- I was so excited to get more door photos from the land of Antarctica

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images/2023-01-31-antarctica/6-gentoo" %}

### killer whale (2/4)

- at first, everyone's autofocus on their cameras wasn't working due to the lack of contrast and the smooth sea
- maternal led
- male and females have different sizes and shape of dorsal fins, males are bigger and more straight
- we are seeing the same group of photographers on the 5/6th floor observation deck at every whale siting
- passing Katies binoculars around to let people see them
- the killer whales had a reddish hue due to ????

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images/2023-01-31-antarctica/6-killer-whale" %}

### spinning in the ice field (2/4)

- due to the killer whale sitting we didn't have time for the zodiac cruise
- bud made an audible and we sailed the entire ship into the ice field
- we were able to get much closer to the large ice burgs in our ship. because they have a chance to roll which would be unsafe in the zodiac
  we spent some time in the hot tub with the sugarmans and the redhead girl
- we rushed out so we could make it to the talk
  {% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images/2023-01-31-antarctica/6.1-brash" %}

### cooks nook dinner & hump backs (2/4)

- saw killer whales at the end of the debrief
  - the wife of the man that is Scott's competitor spotted them
  - they were circling an iceberg with penguins on it
  - the captain was there and said we will only stop for really good sitings (jokingly)
  - I ran down and grabbed the camera and took a 1 min video from our balcony
  - was late to dinner
- during the second course, I noticed a humpback and ran outside to grab some pictures
- right before our main bud came on the horn and announced humpbacks
  - they were everywhere
  - 3 groups, one of 6 and two of two
  - it was so hard to know where to pay attention to as the blows and whale whales (the animal and the sounds) were coming from every here
  - I stayed outside without a coat until my fingers were ready to fall off

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images/2023-01-31-antarctica/6.1-humpback" %}

### transit through the lemaire channel (2/5)

- bud woke the ship up at 6 am after the late night of the crew talent show
- I got the most bitter coffee and ended up throwing it out for a latte instead
- while on the 6th-floor observation deck I saw a humpback tale as it dove
- It was really hard to get up but we figured if bud says so it's worth it and it's our last full day so we should power through
- we got sooo cold being outside for an hour in 0.4C weather
- I was happy that we were in the second group for the excursion so that we had time to warm up
- this area really felt like Antarctica with the ice-capped islands and stunning mountains
- it was cool being able to spot the penguin colonies and see their trails along the snow between the rock outcroppings

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images/2023-01-31-antarctica/7-channel" %}

### Petermann Island (2/5)

- we went on a zodiac tour before the island
- it was nice to have some time to rest and not be the first group
- on the zodiac tour we saw "rafts" of penguins
- bonnie found a cool-looking iceberg that was like the Loch Ness Monster
- in the distance, we saw 3 humpbacks
- the penguins were on the beach so we had to do another sketchy landing where they ram the zodiac up onto a rock and hope it sticks with the waves
- I watched a Gentoo(?) penguin fight off a skuwa
- there was a Weddell seal chilling and scratching itself on the ice
- I wanted to get a photo of the boat framed with the seal scratching itself in a U shape but no such luck/patience
- we got some cool photos of penguin tracks in the watermelon snow
  it was incredibly impressive to see the penguins traverse the steep rock and to see how far they commute from their nests to the sea and back
- there were also a ton of penguins that would walk a little and then fall (sometimes intentionally sometimes not) and then slide down on their belly. it was the cutest thing ever

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images/2023-01-31-antarctica/7-island" %}

### lemaire channel 2nd time (2/5)

- the morning was foggy but this time it was very clear
- we headed up to the bridge to watch and were torn between watching from the bow or heading to

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images/2023-01-31-antarctica/7.1-channel" %}

### engine room tour (2/5)

- there are 4 generators 2 in one room and 2 in another
- the ship is built with every system being redundant
- the ship is capable of being given a GPS coordinate and then staying in that exact location
- there is a water treatment plant on board for all the sewage, food waste and greywater
  - it is dumped overseas in the drake passage
- the generator that was running was incredibly load and we had to wear earplugs
- all the wiring and tubing was sprayed with a white fire-resistant coating
- we learned that the ship is stabilized with two wings that stick out on each side
  - the stabilizers don't work in the ice fields because the ice could easily destroy them
- we invited the sugarmen's to join us

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images/2023-01-31-antarctica/7.1-engine-room" %}


### mainland in Paradise harbor (2/5)

- the excursion was sold to us as a 10 minute stop
- just enough time to snap a picture
- we landed the zodiacs snapped our pictures with the true south flag and they got obsessed with the wildlife
- we saw elephant seals, Weddell seals and ?? penguins
- as I was walking along the beach one of the penguins popped out of the water. It seemed like it appeared out of nowhere
- we landed across a small inlet from the Arenginian brown base
- some of the researchers came out to the porch to watch us
- others climbed to the top of the closest mountain and waved

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images/2023-01-31-antarctica/7.1-mainland" %}

### igloo (2/5)

- we put our name in for the lottery to stay the night on deck in the igloo
- we didn't get picked for the lottery
- they built the igloos on this ship due to the high number of guests who wanted to sleep on deck
- this evening after touching the mainland we wanted to watch the scenery on our way out of paradise
- we sat on the bed trying our best to be present
- although the mountains, icebergs and whale sightings brought us back to our camera again and again

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images/2023-01-31-antarctica/7.2-igloo" %}

## drake shake 2.0 (2/6)

- could finally sleep in we are both exhausted from the long action paced days
- we each had to pick 5 photos to submit for the guest slide show
- I cheated and added 7
- it was soooo hard to narrow them down
  Katie did a little editing on all of ours and showed me some tricks with Preview

{% include image-gallery.html folder="/assets/images/2023-01-31-antarctica/8-drake" %}

## 2/7

- the drake shake was stronger when we awoke
- on our way up to the bridge after breakfast, we hit a really big swell. we both stopped immediately and grabbed hold of hand railing on either side
- we packed the majority of our things which was challenging given all our extras from the cruise (mainly our giant parkas)
- we passed cape horn and the sea was really still.
- kate bought the chef's apron. He had all the kitchen staff sign it for her
  he was incredibly nice about it
  - she had mentioned wanting to buy it at the cook's nook and a few days before
  - at the cook's nook multiple people thought there is no way or that she was joking
- we sat in the hot tub while traversing beagle channel
- it was really exciting seeing the guest slide show. so many good photographers
- bud and the captain explained how unique our cruise was with "calm"-ish drake passage, a calm trip around cape horn, tons of expeditions, and a landing on ross island (something bud has only done twice in his career)
- One of the engine room crew took a map of the area and drew penguins, the ship, whales and seals on it each night during the journey. using his free time. They auctioned it off with the proceeds going to an employee welfare fund for family emergencies, gifts of appreciation and amenities in the crew courters. someone bought it for $6800. When the bidding stalled out at 4500 a guest got up and told everyone how amazing the crew was.
- the captain and bud did a bunch of acknowledgments of how great the crew and naturalist were. during Bud's chat the British gentleman got up and had very nice words and lead 3 hip hip horas
  at dinner, the captain came around again to parade the kitchen staff around the dining room so we could show our appreciation
  - during this Rodger was causing a ruckus with the guests and called him out by name and then said "I love you too Rodger"
- the cook sold Katie his apron and had each of the kitchen staff sign it. he was super nice about it. he mentioned he bought it for about 30 USD and would take whatever she thought was a fair price
  - he also threw in a magnet from the Ukrainian research base
  - Katie took inspiration from the signatures and purchased a buff and got as many of the crew and guests to sign the buff and take a photo with Peggy
- we got off the boat after dinner and saw the hostel that was so nice to Katie when an ATM ate her debit card

## 2/8

- got up at 6:30 to bud on the horn. (the only bud wake-up call that wasn't absolutely amazing)
  after breakfast, we disembarked and headed to the prison museum
  - we found the cooks apron in the gift shop
- we then walked to town
- we loved all the maps that had Argentinian land claims to the horn of Antarctica, the falcon islands and the Georgian islands
