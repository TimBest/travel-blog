Due to our shorter than anticipate Visa in Vietnam. We needed somewhere to go before arriving in New Zealand. We considered spending more time in Seoul but wanted to check out more of south East Asia. With the added benefit of being nicer on our budget.

We were both feeling a bit traveled out and figured a stay on the beach would help. Katherine looked at all the best beaches and narrowed it down to Bali and the Philippines. While Bali was physically further away. It had few connections and some of the best diving in the world.

We both independently before we met had been wanting to get SCUBA certified. and have gotten advise over and over again to get certified in a destination with good diving.

We consider it in Zanzibar but ended up not doing it because of me being sick and adopting Paka. So we figure why not do it now!!!
Arriving

We arrived in Bali in the evening, already dark out, and both starving. The only airline available had been a budget airline (VIeJet??). Which we didn't get a meal on. We got through customs and met up with our driver. Dropped our stuff off and went back to the airport for dinner and some snacks (amazing sashuka, smoothies, banana bread and dried apricots).

After our quick bite, we met up with our driver and began the 2.5-hour drive to Amed. We drove through the mountains all the way across the island. Not getting to our stay until 10:30 PM. A long and exhausting day.

The next day our goal was to recover and say hi to our dive instructor. We slept in and got breakfast at our stay before walking the 10 minutes along the beach to the dive shop. (we had chosen this stay intentionally to be within walking distance of the shop). We met Martin and Laura and signed our waivers.

We then went to a Mexican restaurant Laura recommended and met the owner Jhonoton. It was the best Mexican food we have had abroad on our trip and made us both feel a bit at home. we then walked back home, napped, and got ready for the week of diving.
