## Street Food Tour

We have been wanting to try more street food and get exposure to more Vietnamese dishes. However, after my experience with food poisoning in Tanzania, we were feeling a bit reticent. We decided to book a food tour to kick-start our curiosity. We tried:

### 1. Sticky Rice at Xôi Yến

At [Xôi Yến](https://www.google.com/maps/place/X%C3%B4i+Y%E1%BA%BFn/@21.0337304,105.8501426,16z/data=!4m7!3m6!1s0x3135abf54e9751af:0x9720e5f2f8f19320!8m2!3d21.0337304!4d105.85452!15sCgd4b2kgeWVuWgkiB3hvaSB5ZW6SARV2aWV0bmFtZXNlX3Jlc3RhdXJhbnTgAQA!16s%2Fg%2F11b75hq4m5?coh=164777&entry=tt) we got a classic sticky rice called Xôi Xéo that is traditionally eaten for breakfast. The sticky rice is topped with mung bean and fried shallots

### 2. Snails at Ốc nóng Ngao hấp

At [Ốc nóng Ngao hấp](https://goo.gl/maps/dauhfZ8R4bEGo4o86) we tried Ốc Luộc Steamed ?freshwater? snails harvested from rice patties. these snails are often eaten as a snack. They were our favorite dish on the tour.

To eat we first had to pry off a hardcover to then be able to stab the snail meat. From there we had to twist the shell off of the meat with the correct pressure so as not to tear the meat and lose the tasty snack. They had a meaty texture reminiscent of some seafood with a much fresher and earthy taste. Some even had a slight crunch and tongue-numbing effect.

We also got to try Ngao hấp steamed white clams with lemongrass, ginger, and pineapple. Which were delicious. But not nearly as exciting as the snails

Our tour guide mentioned how Hanoi made it very easy for people to start businesses. So many folks will pay a landlord or shop owner to use the sidewalk space in front of their building as a restaurant.
