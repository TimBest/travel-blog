Many of the hotel rooms we stay in haven't been used since pre-COVID. It seems that almost universally hotels close their upper floors and operate out of the rooms on the first or second floor. When visiting Hanoi they put us on the 4th floor. Katie asked if we could move to the 6th floor (the Highest one). They moved us and the room was dusty. In Siem Reap, we asked for a higher floor and got a room that smelt a bit off. We are happy with the trade-off of a little dirty for a better view. Especially since we are staying for a few nights and housekeeping is quick to clean the room.

Many of the guides we hire have been out of work for COVID. It has been heartbreaking to hear how hard things have been. In Tanzania, their entire economy is built on tourism. So everyone suffered.

In Zanzibar, we talked with a Taxi driver who was no longer able to give rides during COVID. As the rate for a taxi by car is too expensive for the locals who seem to either take motorbike taxis. There also seems to be a small fraction that owns their own car or has a private driver. This taxi driver told us since COVID he is now trying to diversify his income with Taxi driving, selling goods in a shop, farming and raising chickens. But it is hard to do the other activities when he is taken away for hours to do the taxi. He then said that he would like to hire someone to run those activities but there are no loans available

We feel conflicted on one hand COVID has provided so much hardship on the other it has given us an amazing opportunity to see the wonders of the world with so few people.
On Kilimanjaro, our guides pointed to a place where the edge of camp was pre-COVID and we then walked another kilometer to the center of camp where we set up our tents.

In Angkor Wat we were able to do a private photo shoot in the main door with less than a dozen people walking through in the time we were there. We have photos of us at the main door with no one in the background as if it was our private abode. This is mainly possible because China's borders are still closed. Looking back at videos from 2018-19 it is clear that the site used to be as packed as a concert.

In Siem reap a shop keep explained to us how COVID caused a brain drain and many of the people who worked in tourism moved to the capital Phomn Phen for work.
