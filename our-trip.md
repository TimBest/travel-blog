**The Great Migration** is an opportunity for us to explore the world, take a break from working to reflect on our lives, and understand one another in a deeper way by traveling together. We are traveling for ~10 months, attempting to visit at least one country per continent (including Antarctica). This where we plan to be, which might change. Here's to adventure!

**May - July 2022: Europe & Africa**
  - Italy: Rome, Pompeii, Cinque Terre, Venice, and the Dolomites
  - Tanzania: Hiking Kilimanjaro, doing a safari in the Serengeti, and relaxing on Zanzibar


**August 2022: North America**
  - USA: Two weddings and a memorial service bring us back to our home continent


**September - December 2022: Asia & Australia**
  - Cambodia: Ankor Wat, and more
  - Vietnam: TBD
  - South Korea: TBD
  - New Zealand: Backpacking to Mount Doom (Lord of the Rings), Great Walks, and beyond


**January - February 2023: South America & Antarctica**
  - South America: Countries are TBD
  - Antarctica: Taking a cruise with Katherine's parents to explore the great snowy continent


We are incredibly excited and grateful to be traveling. Thank you for following our adventures!
