**The Great Migration** is an opportunity for us to explore the world, take a break from working to reflect on our lives, and understand one another in a deeper way by traveling together. We are traveling for 10 months, attempting to visit one country per continent (plus Antarctica). This where we plan to be, which might change. Here's to adventure!

- **May - July 2022: Europe & Africa**
  - Italy: Rome, Pompeii, Cinque Terre, Venice, and the Dolomites
  - Tanzania: Hiking Kilimanjaro, doing a safari in the Serengeti, and relaxing on Zanzibar
- **August 2022: North America**
  - USA: Two weddings and a memorial service bring us back to our home continent
- **September - October 2022: Asia**
  - Cambodia: Ankor Wat, and more
  - Vietnam: TBD
  - South Korea: TBD
- **November - December 2022: Australia**
  - New Zealand: Backpacking to Mount Doom (Lord of the Rings), Great Walks, and beyond
- **January 2023: South America & Antarctica**
