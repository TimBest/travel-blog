### reserva nacional magallanes (1/7)

- the long day of sunshine was amazing
- in NY we were getting tired around 4 pm and going to sleep around 9/9:3 but when we got to punta arenas it was 11 pm and still bright out and we weren't ready to sleep
- we had to close all our shades to trick our brains into sleeping at the right time
- we got a taxi to the park. the driver was nice but very confused and it took a good 5or 10 minutes to convince him to take us
  -the park was beautiful it felt like an alpine climate but so close to the ocean
  we got a beautiful vista of the town, and walked through forests with endless trees
- met a couple from ??? and ended up chatting at a visit until we all got cold from not moving. they were super nice
- at the visitor center, we got a taxi and ended up sharing it with a Germen couple in their early 2s
  -one side of the loop we did was full of local families and a group of tourists from a cruise
- the other side was only local families
- it was really nice to be at a park that felt like a local stopping ground and not the most epic thing ever

### Penguins

the population had declined and is now 33% of what it was when Katie last visited. mainly due to destructive fishing practices forcing the penguins to go further for their food

- took a photo of Peggy with the no touching penguins sign. the tour guide saw us doing this and had quite a chuckle
- we were there when the chick were only a few weeks old
- they were super cute
- the gulls also had chicks it was hard to know which ones to focus on
- one of the positives of the tours is that the human presence keeps the skuwas away and more penguins survive
- stopped at the seal island
- was so hard to capture with still photos since there were so many of them

### whale watching

- Katie pointing out the mountain, Tim looking over and sees dolphins, thinking she was pointing the dolphins out tim starts high-speed shooting, katie tells him to stop making fun of her. confusion is resolved. we both have a good laugh

### food poisoning

- bad parmasan scallops
- though I was going to be okay in the morning since I was holding things down
- but it continued and when I was having trouble stnding up I called it and katie took me to the hospital
- navigating the hospital with the language barrior and being sick was incredibly difficult
- we were waiting in the waiting room to be triaged and I needed to be close to the bathroom.
- the first time my number was called I couldn't get off the toilet
- the second time I went to the triage room but needed to leave I told the nurse I was going to the bathroom and she said no. we went back and forth 3 times until I just got up and left
- I then got a bed but had to wait for a really long time before an IV
- they gave me an IV and a bunch of anti virals

### trip extension

### breakfast

the hotels breakfast was amazing it consisted of

- instant coffee & tea
- two juice boxes
- two milk boxes
- slices of ham and cheese
- four pieces of toast
- 4 eggs
  this allowed us so many permutations on breakfast and lunch.
- we could eat a bowl of cereal, make a melt and hard boil the eggs to take for lunch
- we could cookk the eggs and take the melt for a snack

- there were some really good breakfast spots so one day we went to ???

  - they had really cool illustration of native animals
  - katie shared about the process of drawing something really large and then shrinking it
  - that way you can sell more at a reasonable price
  - and the smaller version is super detailed

- going out to eat for burgers and the waiter telling me my spanish was really good after butchering my order and Katie helping me get the right pronunciation on each word
