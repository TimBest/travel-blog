## drake shake 2.0 (2/6)

- could finally sleep in we are both exhausted from the long action paced days
- we each had to pick 5 photos to submit for the guest slide show
- I cheated and added 7
- it was soooo hard to narrow them down
  Katie did a little editing on all of ours and showed me some tricks with Preview

## 2/7

- the drake shake was stronger when we awoke
- on our way up to the bridge after breakfast, we hit a really big swell. we both stopped immediately and grabbed hold of hand railing on either side
- we packed the majority of our things which was challenging given all our extras from the cruise (mainly our giant parkas)
- we passed cape horn and the sea was really still.
- kate bought the chef's apron. He had all the kitchen staff sign it for her
  he was incredibly nice about it
  - she had mentioned wanting to buy it at the cook's nook and a few days before
  - at the cook's nook multiple people thought there is no way or that she was joking
- we sat in the hot tub while traversing beagle channel
- it was really exciting seeing the guest slide show. so many good photographers
- bud and the captain explained how unique our cruise was with "calm"-ish drake passage, a calm trip around cape horn, tons of expeditions, and a landing on ross island (something bud has only done twice in his career)
- One of the engine room crew took a map of the area and drew penguins, the ship, whales and seals on it each night during the journey. using his free time. They auctioned it off with the proceeds going to an employee welfare fund for family emergencies, gifts of appreciation and amenities in the crew courters. someone bought it for $6800. When the bidding stalled out at 4500 a guest got up and told everyone how amazing the crew was.
- the captain and bud did a bunch of acknowledgments of how great the crew and naturalist were. during Bud's chat the British gentleman got up and had very nice words and lead 3 hip hip horas
  at dinner, the captain came around again to parade the kitchen staff around the dining room so we could show our appreciation
  - during this Rodger was causing a ruckus with the guests and called him out by name and then said "I love you too Rodger"
- the cook sold Katie his apron and had each of the kitchen staff sign it. he was super nice about it. he mentioned he bought it for about 30 USD and would take whatever she thought was a fair price
  - he also threw in a magnet from the Ukrainian research base
  - Katie took inspiration from the signatures and purchased a buff and got as many of the crew and guests to sign the buff and take a photo with Peggy
- we got off the boat after dinner and saw the hostel that was so nice to Katie when an ATM ate her debit card

## 2/8

- got up at 6:30 to bud on the horn. (the only bud wake-up call that wasn't absolutely amazing)
  after breakfast, we disembarked and headed to the prison museum
  - we found the cooks apron in the gift shop
- we then walked to town
- we loved all the maps that had Argentinian land claims to the horn of Antarctica, the falcon islands and the Georgian islands
