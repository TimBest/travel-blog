{% include youtube.html code="Qgjfk-offj8" %}

- cold water
- lazy morning with everyone doing separate runs
- super chaotic
- tons of kicks to the face
- making weird noises
- two swims
  The first one was amazing
  - 2nd there were >100 dolphins all super interested in us
  - did a dozen loops with one dolphin and got dizzy and totally exhausted
  - kicked in the face and lost my snorkel
  - if you started swimming in a circle they would show up
  - making all sorts of funny noises to attract them
  - couldn't hear the dolphin clicks but the gopro picked them up

## Whale watching

#### sperm whales facts

- only males in the area. here to eat food and get big so they can mate. females stay in the tropics. the largest male gets to mate
- named for the 2.5 tons of oil in their head which is milky white. later found out the females have the oil too but the name had stuck
- largest animal
  can tell cold-blooded animals from warm via echolocation
- squid filter slat out of the water via their tears so the sperm whales love squid because that is where they get their water
- can and have eaten great white sharks whole
- eats all their pray whole
- would be the apex predator of the sea but the Orcas take the title because they eat cold and warm-blooded animals
  the brain is the size of a basketball
- stays at the surface for a few breaths and then will stay underwater for 45min to an hour

#### What we saw

- sperm whale
- fin whale
- fur seals
- dusky dolphins
  jellyfish
- tons of marine birds
