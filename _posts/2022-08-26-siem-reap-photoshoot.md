After seeing numerous families take photos at Angkor Wat, we decided to get matching outfits and take photos ourselves. We connected with a local history tour guide to do this. He spoke fluent English, so I taught him how to use the camera and frame shots. In the end, we took photos at four different sites and loved the images that were captured. Here are some of our favorites!
