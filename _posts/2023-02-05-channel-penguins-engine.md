### transit through the lemaire channel (2/5)

- bud woke the ship up at 6 am after the late night of the crew talent show
- I got the most bitter coffee and ended up throwing it out for a latte instead
- while on the 6th-floor observation deck I saw a humpback tale as it dove
- It was really hard to get up but we figured if bud says so it's worth it and it's our last full day so we should power through
- we got sooo cold being outside for an hour in 0.4C weather
- I was happy that we were in the second group for the excursion so that we had time to warm up
- this area really felt like Antarctica with the ice-capped islands and stunning mountains
- it was cool being able to spot the penguin colonies and see their trails along the snow between the rock outcroppings

### Petermann Island (2/5)

- we went on a zodiac tour before the island
- it was nice to have some time to rest and not be the first group
- on the zodiac tour we saw "rafts" of penguins
- bonnie found a cool-looking iceberg that was like the Loch Ness Monster
- in the distance, we saw 3 humpbacks
- the penguins were on the beach so we had to do another sketchy landing where they ram the zodiac up onto a rock and hope it sticks with the waves
- I watched a Gentoo(?) penguin fight off a skuwa
- there was a Weddell seal chilling and scratching itself on the ice
- I wanted to get a photo of the boat framed with the seal scratching itself in a U shape but no such luck/patience
- we got some cool photos of penguin tracks in the watermelon snow
  it was incredibly impressive to see the penguins traverse the steep rock and to see how far they commute from their nests to the sea and back
- there were also a ton of penguins that would walk a little and then fall (sometimes intentionally sometimes not) and then slide down on their belly. it was the cutest thing ever

### lemaire channel 2nd time (2/5)

- the morning was foggy but this time it was very clear
- we headed up to the bridge to watch and were torn between watching from the bow or heading to

### engine room tour (2/5)

- there are 4 generators 2 in one room and 2 in another
- the ship is built with every system being redundant
- the ship is capable of being given a GPS coordinate and then staying in that exact location
- there is a water treatment plant on board for all the sewage, food waste and greywater
  - it is dumped overseas in the drake passage
- the generator that was running was incredibly load and we had to wear earplugs
- all the wiring and tubing was sprayed with a white fire-resistant coating
- we learned that the ship is stabilized with two wings that stick out on each side
  - the stabilizers don't work in the ice fields because the ice could easily destroy them
- we invited the sugarmen's to join us

### mainland in Paradise harbor (2/5)

- the excursion was sold to us as a 10 minute stop
- just enough time to snap a picture
- we landed the zodiacs snapped our pictures with the true south flag and they got obsessed with the wildlife
- we saw elephant seals, Weddell seals and ?? penguins
- as I was walking along the beach one of the penguins popped out of the water. It seemed like it appeared out of nowhere
- we landed across a small inlet from the Arenginian brown base
- some of the researchers came out to the porch to watch us
- others climbed to the top of the closest mountain and waved

### igloo (2/5)

- we put our name in for the lottery to stay the night on deck in the igloo
- we didn't get picked for the lottery
- they built the igloos on this ship due to the high number of guests who wanted to sleep on deck
- this evening after touching the mainland we wanted to watch the scenery on our way out of paradise
- we sat on the bed trying our best to be present
- although the mountains, icebergs and whale sightings brought us back to our camera again and again
