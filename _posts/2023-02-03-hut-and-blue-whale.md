  - he was the guide for the hut
  - he said he felt funny talking about it to the guest because the leading expert on the hut was one of the Argentines outside in the tents
  - Katie and him both lived in the presidio and chatted about that
- they had to move the boat further away when we were ashore to avoid a drifting iceberg

### the blue whale (2/3)

- spent an hour cruising alongside a blue whale and its baby
- we were in the lecture and they announced the sitting right as it ended
- we all rushed outside with our cameras and no coats the temperature was 2C and wind speeds from 38 to 50 Knotts
- we shot from the aft. when the whale moved to the bow. I ran to the room to get my coat
- ran out on deck 5 and the up to the 6 th floor observation deck
- Katie ran back to get my gloves
- eventually the wind and cold got to be too much and we went to the bridge
