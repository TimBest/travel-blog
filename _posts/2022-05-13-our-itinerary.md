Today is the last day that either of us will be in the workforce for a while. The pandemic
has robbed us of our adventures. Tim is turning 30. Katherine has wanderlust. We
are in our one-third-life-crisis stage, because why not?? Weâ€™ve decided to
travel the world instead. Before things like pets, house owning, and kids keep us
rooted. No regrets!
