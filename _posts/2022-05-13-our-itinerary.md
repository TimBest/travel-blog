Today is the last day that either of us will be in the workforce for a while. The pandemic
has robbed us of our adventures. Tim is turning 30. Katherine has wanderlust. We
are in our one-third-life-crisis stage, because why not?? We’ve decided to
travel the world instead. Before things like pets, house owning, and kids keep us
rooted. No regrets!

Here’s our itinerary:

- May 20th - Fly to Rome and explore Italy. Including Venice Biennale & Hiking in the Dolomites
- Mid-June – Hiking Kilimanjaro (Tanzania)
- Late June - Going on a Safari to see the Great Migration of 800,000 wildebeests, zebra, and more in Tanzania
- Mid-July – Some beach days in Zanzibar (Tanzania)
- Mid-July to Late August – 2 weddings and 1 memorial 
- September to mid-Oct – Japan – Hiking, good food, cultural and historical sites
- Mid-Oct to mid-Dec – New Zealand – Backpacking and nature exploring galore!!!!! Including backpacking to Mount Doom (the Lord of the Rings trail)
- January – South America - possible Patagonia area. possible a trip into the amazon
- Late Jan – Antarctica
