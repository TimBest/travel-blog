Rivertrees was an absolutly beautiful place to stay. They had amazing gardens and it was the perfet hassel free place to recover from Kilimanjaro. 


## Washing Machine 
Given that we had packed light for our entire trip. The week in tin cold mountain had managed to make all of our cloths dirty. Many of which were technical outdoor gear that we didn't want to be ruined in the hotel wash. So we decided to wash them our selves in our room. Thankfully hand washing clouths in Tanzania is quite popular and the hotel had a great sink for it. We first rinsed every garmet in the sink to remove the dust and mud. Then they went into the tub to soak in a soaply mixture. After that Tim rinsed them again in the sink and Katherine acted as the spin cycle rolling each garment in a dry towel to get the moisture out. By the end every available spot in the room had hangers air drying our cloths. When houskeeping stopped by to drop off some more towels and hnagers they said it looked like we were opening up a clothing shop. We all had a good laugh at the obsuritiy of the situation.


## Owls

One day at our stay on our way back to our room. We were taking photos of all the plants in the gardnes a grounds keeper stopped use. He didn't speak but wrote O-W-L-S in the pathway. Excited he lead us over to two aferican wood owls. We watched them for a while and took many photos while they slept. The clicking of the camera did wake them just enough for them took look at us, see we weren't a threat and go back to sleep.

## Monkeys

In the morning we woke up to Vevret and black and white monkeys jumping on our roof. It was nice to sit on the porch of where we were staying and watch them eat

## Pharmacy

Most of our time in Tanzinia are prepland experiances with a guide. We joke that we come to tanzinia and don't even step foot in the country. Due to some missplaning we had run out of a few things like floss and toothpaste. For the first time in our trip we stepped out into Tanzinia. 

We deffintely stood out being the only white people around. It was an interesting and new experiance getting so much attention. On the way we passed 2 school childern walking home. They said hello and when we replied with Jumbo. They were clearly annoyed that we were speaking swahili and they were unable to practice thier english. 

At the pharmacy we were able to get nearly everything we needed and there was a local weekly market set up. It was really cool to see all of the shop.
