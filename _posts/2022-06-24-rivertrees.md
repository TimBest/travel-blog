We booked [Rivertrees](https://rivertrees.com/) after chatting with a coworker that had stayed their before his safari. It was 100% the right decision. Rivertrees was an absolutely beautiful place to stay. The secluded gardens made for the perfect environment to recover from Kilimanjaro and recuperate before embarking on our Safari. Additionally, the low altitude, moderate temperatures and high humidity level were a much need reprieve. Our body and lips thanked us.

## Washing Machine

When planing for this trip we had tried to keep everything we were taking under {% include tooltip.html text="15kg" tip="33lbs" %}. This was the constraint we had though we were going to experience for flying out of the serengeti. (Little did we know that the limit was really {% include tooltip.html text="20kg" tip="44lbs" %} and that it was unenforced). Given the light packing our week on Kilimanjaro manged to make our entire wardrobes dirty. Our cloths had managed to pick up a fine dust from the alpine desert and were caked in mud from the rain forest.


Much of our clothing is technical outdoor gear that we didn't want to be ruined in the hotel wash. So we decided to wash them ourselves in our room. Thankfully hand washing clothes in Tanzania is quite popular and the hotel had a great sink for it. We first rinsed each garment in the sink to remove the dust and mud. Then it went into the tub to soak in a soapy mixture. After that I rinsed them again in the sink and Katherine was our spin cycle, rolling each garment in a dry towel to get most of the moisture out. By the end every available spot in the room had hangers air drying our cloths. Part way through Katherine went to housekeeping to request more hangers and towels. When they came to drop them off said it looked like we were opening up a clothing shop. We all had a good laugh at the absurdity of the situation.

## Owls

Katherine's spirit animal is an owl. We knew Rivertrees was the right place for us when we arrived and saw the sign to reception with an owl on it. Then we got our room key and ended up in the Barred Owlets.

On our last day at Rivertrees we decided to take some photos of the grounds. As we were photographing the gardens a grounds keeper stopped us. He didn't speak but grabbed a stick and wrote O-W-L-S in the pathway. With great enthusiasm he lead us over to a tree containing two african wood owls! We watched them for a while and took many photos while they slept. The clicking of the camera woke them just enough for them took look at us, see we weren't a threat and go back to sleep.

## Monkeys

In the morning we woke up to black & white monkeys, vervet monkeys and cats jumping on our roof. While I really wanted to sleep in. There alarm clock brought me too siting on the porch each morning. From thr porch I was able to watch the monkeys up close. I got to observe them eating small bugs from the ground and off of each other. They seemed very comfortable with my presence and at one point even jumped up on the the porch and walk just a few feet away from me.

## Pharmacy

Our time so far in Tanzania was almost exclusively on Kilimanjaro where we were always with a guide. We joke that we had come to Tanzania and had yet to step foot in the country. As our experience with the guides was highly curated and the hotels felt like separate environments that could have been anywhere in the world.

At this point in our trip we had run out of some of the toilette's that we had brought with us. Thankfully there was a pharmacy within walking distance of Rivertrees. This pharmacy provided a good excuse for us to leave our secluded tourist bubble. One our walk it was apparent that we stuck out as the only white people there. It was an interesting experience getting so much attention. On the way we passed 2 school children walking home. They said "Hello" and when we replied with "Jumbo", they were clearly annoyed that we were speaking Swahili and they were unable to practice their English.  At the pharmacy we were able to get nearly everything we needed and we happened to be there during the weekly market. We had a fun time poking our head into the stall and looking at the goods. Overall, we felt completely safe and we continue to chuckle about the school disappointed children who want to practice their english.
