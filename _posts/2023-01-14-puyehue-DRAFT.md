### rental car fun

- we delayed our flight due to my food poisoning
- katie called hurtz?? and they weren't able to change our reservation due to it being booked through a 3rd party but assured us the car would still be there
- when we showed up to the purto montte airport the company was completely out of cars
- the 4 other people in line with us were out of luck as well
- we went up and down the line of rental car companies asking if any of them had cars. non did but one guy said he knew a guy in town
- 15 minutes later we were signing a form to rent a car from him
- the interaction felt a little sketchy but he did have some offical carbon copy paper which made it feel a little more legit
- we had originally rented an automatic so we could split the driving and on the plane over katie agreed to drive since I still hadent eaten anything solid all day
- but with the last-minute rental via "the guy" they only had a manual
  -so I drove the 2.5 hours to our stay
  -we didn't get there until just before dark

### las juntas eco lodge

- the manager of the lodge was super nice
- the expresso machine was directly under our bed and served as an alarm clock

### Puyehue national park

- attack of the flys in the parking lot
- I was finally feeling a little better and katie got sick (presumably from the water supply)
- we went by yet another hot spring where the starts did not align for us to enjoy it
- when we decided to turn around ended up being the end of the trail we were trying to go to
- we stopped in town for some groceries
- went down by the lack to watch the birds and the sunset
- beautiful views from our room
