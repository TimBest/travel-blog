## Ngorongoro

Ngorongoro crater was a spectacular way to start our safari. Our guide Honest picked us up bright and early at the river tree lodge. We made the drive to Arusha town in the huge Toyota land cruiser. It felt a bit silly to have such a big vehicle for just the two of us. When we arrived in Arusha town, the central downtown area, we picked up our cook Benedict and he quickly filled the vehicle with food, kitchen supplies and our tenting gear for the planed hike. We then drove 3 hours to the crater.

Arriving at Ngorongoro Crater feels like entering Jurassic park. There is a huge entrance gate. From the gate we ascended the side of the crater for ~30 minutes until reaching a beautiful vista of the crater. From here we could see many herds of wildebeest, buffalo and zebra. From the view point it was another quick 30 minute drive into the crater to where we ate lunch next to a elephant skull and surrounded by Superb Starlings. Right after passing some buffalo and a male ostrich

In the crater it felt even more like Jurassic park with some many different wild animals forming a stable self contained ecosystem. All surrounded by natural cliff wall whose top were covered in fog (rewrite to include the fact the inside the crater was clear and sunny).

After lunch we went through the small forest in the crater and passed within feet of two groups of elephants. In the second group we got to watch a baby elephant scratch an itch behind its head with a tree no more than 4 meters from the truck. Before watching the whole group cross the road behind us. 

Soon after the elephants our guide Honest saw a sleeping leopard in a tree. We still don't know how he managed to see it while also driving the car. For we could barely make it out with our binoculars. 

After the leopard our day continued to get even more exciting we saw zebra, wildabeast, gazelle, hippos, flamingos and hyenas. At one point a hyena even passed on the road right out side of our car.

After that it was getting late and our guide was huring us along. He told us this was due to the 6pm curfue when everyone must be out of the crater but we soon found out this was because someone on the radio had let him know that there were lions sleeping on the road up ahead. We stoped along with 4 other trucks to watch a male and female lion rest on the road. They seemed completely unperturbed due to our presence all all the noise we made gauking in awe.

After staying with the lions for a while were seriously running out of time in the crater. We and the other trucks started haling it. The roads are all dirt and quite bumpy so we had to hang on tight as we were josled around. However on our way to the gate we passed two lionnesses activly hunting a zebra. Even with our time crunch we stopped to watch the exchange. In this case the Zebra managed to get away and we mangaged to get out of the park at 5:55pm. Right before the gate closed.


Almost in irony we stayed at the Rino lodge. The rino being the only animal from the great 5 that we didn't see that day. Even thought the crater is know for being able to see Rinos. 

## Hospital

The next day I awoke at 5 am with a nasty case of food poisoning. My body quickly got rid of everything inside. I was convinced that it would quickly pass and we would still be able to go on our hike and camp over night in the [!!!!!] crater. Katherine, our cook bendict and our guide Honset were less convinced.  We waited until noon to see if my condition would improve but by that time I was still unable to keep down water and had become severly dehydrated. We scarped any hope of safari that day and drove to the hospital. Our guide knew of an american doctor who ran an amazing clininc [name of clinic here] near by in ????.

At the hospital they saw me very quickly with barely a 5 minute wait. The doctor asked a few questions and then tried to collect a bllod sample from my hand but was unable to get enoguh blood for how dehydrated I had become. I got an IV and was pumped with over 1 liter of liquid meanwhile they were finally able to take a blood, urine and stool sample. All the test came back within 20minutes and everything looked good.

We walked out with some medicaation for my stomach and to help prevent more diareea. Overall the experiance was unplesent but bound to happen when traveling and we were happy that it happend close to a good hospital.


## Lake Natron

Lake Natron seemed like a stop that was quite different in the past but has changed a lot with the rising gobal temperature. The area was colder then it should have been during this time of year and had incredible winds that kicked up so much dust that it was unpleasent to be out side for any length of time. 

Our highlights were walking to the flamingo breeding ground in the lake, seeing some giraffes near the hotel observing the dried salt and wildabeast tracks in the lakes shore. 

Our stay was nice and when Katherine and I walked in we both immediatly fell in love with the bed spread. One thing I have learned from Katherine is to always ask and one peice of advise I had recived from a katherine and a cowroker was that when traveling if you see something you love buy it.

In the morning Katherine asked our guide to ask the hotel if we could buy the quilt and two pillows. Not beliving her, The guide said he would ask where they bought it from so we could get our own. So instead Katherin asked on of the staff herself. They laughed and quickly said no. She ask if they could ask thier manager and they did. Soon after the we were walking to our room with the same staff memeber to get the quilt and 2 pillow cases to purchase. 

I think the whole staff and our guide had never seen this type of interaction before and were ammused and fasinated. I am sure they all will go home to tell their familys of the tourist the baought the quilt right off the bed.
