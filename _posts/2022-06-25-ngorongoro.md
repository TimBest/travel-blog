Ngorongoro crater was a spectacular way to start our safari. Our guide Honest picked us up bright and early at Rivertrees. We made the drive to Arusha town in the huge Toyota land cruiser. At the time it felt silly having such a big vehicle for just the two of us. However, as we the safari progressed we loved having the space. We would actively jump between seats to get a better angle in pursuit of the best view or photo. On the way we got to learn more about Tanzanian's first president [Julius Nyerere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julius_Nyerere) and current president [Samia Suluhu Hassan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samia_Suluhu_Hassan). When we arrived in Arusha town, the central downtown area, we picked up our cook Benedict and he quickly filled the vehicle with food, kitchen supplies and our tenting gear for the planed hike. We then drove the 3 hours to the crater.

## Entering the Park

Arriving at Ngorongoro Crater feels like entering Jurassic park. To get into the park we drove under a massive gate with huge doors. (sadly we didn't get a photo). From the gate we ascended the side of the crater for ~30 minutes. As we ascended we could see less and less as we entered a layer of fog. Our guide explained that the crater was formed from a volcanic mountain in which the peak had collapsed leaving this crater. And that due to its topography and elevation  the rim of the crater is very cold and is often covered in fog. We took a quick stop at a vista for a photo and to admire the many herds of wildebeest, buffalo and zebra.

## Descending the Crater Walls

From the vista we started our descent into the crater for another 30 minute drive. And this is when the Jurassic Park vibes really amplified. The wall of the crater formed this natural wall that stretched all the way across the horizon. The fog added an additional layer making the natural wall appear so tall that they were lost in the clouds. Our guide informed us that the crater was home to roughly 25,000 resident animals.

Once we had gotten all the way down the crater wall we were meet by a group of buffalo. Our first animal interaction and one of the big five down. We watched the buffalo for a few minutes and they clearly watch us back. As we sat there we were able to watch a number of oxpeckers land on the buffalo and graze on their hides.

At this point our stomachs started rumbling for some lunch so Honest drove us to a picnic area near by. On the way we made a quick detour to observer a male ostrich. We ended up eating our lunch right next to an elephant skull and were joined by some Superb Starlings. After eating the boxed lunches Benedict had prepared for us we dipped into some of the snacks we brought from amsterdam. Neither Honest or Benedict had ever had Baklava. So we shared the last of some that we had picked up from a turkish grocer in Amsterdam

## The Forest

After lunch we drove through a small patch forest in the crater and passed within feet of two groups of elephants. Completing two of the big five. In the second group we got to watch a baby elephant scratch an itch behind its head with a tree no more than 4 meters from the truck. Before watching the whole group cross the road behind us. 

Withing minutes of seeing the elephants our guide pointed out a group of guineafowls. Apparently, some locals in Tanzania keep guineafowls and according to our guide the birds and their eggs have a superior taste to chicken.

### The Leopard

As we continued drive in the forest. And while driving at least 20 miles an hour Honest was able to see a leopard way in the distance and almost completely obscured by branches. We still have no idea how he managed to see it. Even after we stopped and he directed us to where it was we could barley make it out in our binoculars. Honest then informed the other guides in the crater of the leopards presences and cars started appearing out of nowhere, As others quickly drove over to see the cat.

At this point we were completely blown away. We had only spent about 3 hours in the park so far and had already seen three of the big five. Additionally, most of our time had been spent driving or eating lunch. At this point we started joking that we didn't even need the ten days of the safari. We would be able to see the big five today and then go home.

After the leopard our day continued to be exciting as for the first time we saw zebra, wildebeest, gazelle, hippos, flamingos, warthogs, kori bustard and hyenas in the wild. The hyena photographed below got so close to the car that if we had opened the door we could have given it a pet.

## The Lions

It was now close the the parks closing time and we were on opposite side of the park as we needed to be. We needed to make it to the other side before the gate closed. On our way Honest was listening to the radio and unbeknownst to us someone called in a lion sighting. We were driving quick on the dirt roads and all of a sudden came apron 4 other trucks parked on the road. We stood up and the was a lioness sleeping right out side. We were ecstatic! And then Honest pointed out that there was a male lion sleeping a little to the left.nThey seemed completely unperturbed by our presence and all the noise we made.

At this point we were so happy with the day. We had seen so much. Had so many new experiences. And were getting seriously close to the closing time. We started booking it towards the exit even faster then before. This time accompanied with the other trucks staying late to admire the lions. The roads are all dirt and quite bumpy so we had to hang on tight as we were jostled around.

### The Hunt

However, on our way to the gate we passed two lionesses actively hunting a zebra! Even with our time crunch we stopped to watch the exchange. In this case the Zebra managed to get away and we managed to get out of the park at 5:55pm. Right before the gate closed. The lions had made it so we saw four of the big five today. The only animal we didn't get to see was the black rhino. Of which there are less then 200 in the entire country of Tanzania. Almost in irony ended up sleeping at the Rhino lodge that night. Overall, we had an amazing day and could not have asked for a better start to our safari
