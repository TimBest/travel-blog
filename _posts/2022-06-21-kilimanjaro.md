Kilimanjaro was hard. We took a direct flight on a Boeing 777 from amsterdam and landed at 8pm local time. With customs and the drive to our hotel. We didn't get into our room until just after midnight. Then we still needed to pack our bags. One to store at the hotel and two to go up Kilimanjaro with our things and the gear we were renting. We quickly learned that our definition of a 'winter coat' differed from the rental companies. Thankfully we were able to get them agree to bring all their 'winter coats' the next morning so we could layer a few to stay warm. All in all we didn't get much sleep that night.

The next morning we awoke around 7 to eat breakfast and sort through our layers. When we walked out of the hotel we were greeted with a bus full of people. 14 in total! The driver, our coordinator, 2 guides, a waiter, a cook and 8 porters. We were quite taken a back with how many people there were to carry our things. As we are use to backpacking by ourselves or with a small group of friends. Where everyone is responsible for carrying their own things and the weight of the communal items is shared. 

## Day 1

| Machame Gate to Machame Camp      |
|------------|----------------------|
| Elevation  | 1800 to 2835 m       |
| Distance   | 11 km                |
| Zone       | #2 Rain Forest       |

On the drive from our hotel to the gate our guides introduced themselves and started telling us about the mountain. Including the five ecological zones:

1. Cultivate
2. Rain forest
3. Heather moorland
4. Alpine dessert
5. Ice glacier

We drove through cultivated zone which was largely covered with banana farms. Arriving at the gate we entered the Rain forest zone and set out on the first day of the Machame Route up the mountain. It was beautiful and reminded us both of Hawaii. We saw baboons eating food that other humans have dropped, many beautiful wild flowers, and a waterfall.

{% include caption.html text="The Elephants Trunk Flower - our favorite from the rain forest zone" %}

This first section of the hike was where we had the most autonomy. Our guides let us hike freely in order to get a sense of how fit we were to submit. Unbeknownst to us at the time. They were watching our hiking to gauge our strength and help inform the pace they would set for us for the remaining days. 

We reached camp about an hour before night fall. It was located right on the border between the rain forest and the heather moorland zones. The temperature was dropping quickly and katherine's bag with all her layers had not yet arrived. Without her layers she was unable to stay warm. This worried our guides and turned out to be a learning lesson for all. For the rest of the trip it was made sure that our bags arrived at camp before us.

## Day 2

| Machame Camp to Shira Cave          |
|------------|------------------------|
| Elevation  | 2835 to 3750 m         |
| Distance   | 5 km                   |
| Zone       | Heather Moorland (#3)  |

The night and morning were colder than we were expecting this early on in the hike. We ate break fest inside a tent that was borough just for our meals. Equipped with a lamp, table, two chairs, dinner ware and serving dishes. Even with all these luxury items breakfast was hard. One of the strategies we use when camping in cold weather is to bring food I absolutely love. This is really beneficial since it can be difficult to keep an apatite when cold and delicious food always goes down easy. However, we were now half way across the world with our food already planed and packed by someone else. Someone who was tasked with cooking western meals without access to western ingredients or pallet.

After breakfast we finally got to meet the whole crew and everyone introduced themselves. We tried to make a point of learning everyone's names. Which we did accomplish in the end although difficult at first. Especially for the porters we didn't interact with.

The hike up to Shira cave was beautiful. The heather moorland was less dense then the forest. However, still offered a wide variety of unique and interesting plants. Our guides were super knowledgeable about all the different plants and were able to answer all our questions. One of our favorite flowers we were introduced to was the everlasting flower. They came in a few different colors and shapes. Including the pink and yellow ones bellow. When touched the petals felt almost like plastic.

We arrived at camp early in the afternoon. Giving us some time to relax. Shira Cave campsite was a beautiful camp site. Katherine got some time to draw one of the trees from the moorland while I had a look around camp. One thing I noticed was how many bones there were in dried up water ways. In asking our guides I found out that it was common to cook beef with the bone in and many cooks will tos the bones on the ground afterwards.

This campsite was also above the clouds and lead to some beautiful views of the night sky. We were able to see the southern cross, the Milky Way, many satellites and even a shooting sar!

## Day 3

| Shira Cave to Lava Tower            |
|------------|------------------------|
| Elevation  | 3750 to 4600 m         |
| Distance   | 7 km                   |
| Zone       | Alpine Desert (#4)     |

| Lava Tower to Barranco              |
|------------|------------------------|
| Elevation  | 4600 to 3900 m         |
| Distance   | 3 km                   |
| Zone       | Heather Moorland (#3) |

{% include caption.html text="A cool ice formation we found in the first hour of our morning hike" %}

Day 3 was a day designed to acclimate us to the higher elevations. Our route brought us up almost 1000 meters exposing us to the altitude. Then it lead us back down almost to the point where we started. So that we could sleep with more air and stay strong. It was a long and difficult day.
 
We left the heather zone into the alpine dessert which had far fewer plants. Although it was still scattered with everlasting flowers. This day was a struggle for both of us and we felt the altitude with every step. This is when we learned {% include tooltip.html text="pole pole" tip="slow slow" %}, the slogan of the mountain. We walked in a single file line one guide in the front and one in the back. The guide in the front set a slow pace for us and took us up the mountain one short step after another.

After reaching the first ridge line on our way to Lava tower we found a spot out of the wind for lunch. Where we were swarmed with many birds. They were bold. While they didn't take any food out of our hands or lunch boxes they did fly over and perch just a few inches from us. Forcing us to play an endless game of shooing them away as we ate.

We stopped again at lava tower for a quick break, some snacks and photos. The camp site was an interesting mix of folks planning to stay the night and larger groups whose team was making them a hot lunch. On our descent our guides we a bit shocked at how slow we both are going down. I think that given our age and fitness they were expecting us to go much faster when not having to work as hard. We shared about our bad knees and practiced pole pole on the way down as well.

![Dendrosenecio kilimanjari](/assets/images/2022-06-21-kilimanjaro/25_trees.jpg)
{% include caption.html text="Dendrosenecio kilimanjari" %}

On the way down we also learned about [Dendrosenecio kilimanjari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrosenecio_kilimanjari) a giant groundsel found on Mount Kilimanjaro. Our guides told us two method of telling their age. The first it to count the rings of dead leaves. Similar to tree rings each one of these rings is about a year. The other way is to count the number of times a trunk splits. As every 25 years the plant will produce a flower and then create 2-4 new branches from that location.

## Day 4

| Barranco to Karanga                 |
|------------|------------------------|
| Elevation  | 3990 to 3995 m         |
| Distance   | 5 km                   |
| Zone       | Alpine Desert (#4)     |

We started out with the most technical part of all of kilimanjaro. It included a little bit of scrambling. Easy for us however incredibly impressive for all the porters. Who were carrying 20 kilos and many were balancing half of that on their heads while ascending. At the ridge line we still had a bit of a hike to go and it was in good view of the snow caped peak. Many of the people we passed on this day were doing the same route we were but in 6 days instead. Where we stopped for camp was where they had lunch and continuing on to base camp.

![Katherine licking salt off the rocks](/assets/images/2022-06-21-kilimanjaro/buffalo.jpg)
{% include caption.html text="Katherine practicing her buffalo impression" %}

Our guides told us about buffalo on the other side of the mountain that one climb up to lick the salt that formed on the rocks. One even went into a small cave to lick the salt only to get stuck and die there.

## Day 5

| Karanga to Barafu                   |
|------------|------------------------|
| Elevation  | 3990 to 4673 m         |
| Distance   | 4 km                   |
| Zone       | Alpine Desert (#4)     |

We had a very short hike up to base camp. When we got there we were able to enjoy a hot lunch, do a final check of the gear we would submit in. Along our route we had rotated around mount kilimanjaro. The view of the ice cap from base cap was breath taking. From her we could also see [?????]. With much admiration or porters and guides told us stories of how KG had formed the first route up the mountain, that it is some of the only technical climbing in Tanzania and that still to this day KG is the only person permitted to go up. 

That night we went to bed as early as we could fall asleep wearing  everything we would submit the mountain in . As we had rented our sleeping bags as to not carry our own all around Europe. As with the jackets we ran into another differing definition. For us a 'winter' sleeping bag keeps you warm and is often most insulative when you are not wearing layers. For the ones we rented the expectation is that you sleep in all of your layers to make up for the lack of insulative properties of the sleeping bag.

## Day 6

| Barafu to Uhuru Peak                |
|------------|------------------------|
| Elevation  | 4673 to 5895 m         |
| Distance   | 5 km                   |
| Zone       | Ice cap (#5)           |

| Uhuru Peak to High Camp             |
|------------|------------------------|
| Elevation  | 5895 to 3950 m         |
| Distance   | 10.5 km                |
| Zone       | Heather Mooreland (#3) |


We were awoken at 11pm. We had a quick drink of tea/hot water and started our march up the mountain. When we left the moon still hadn't risen. It was dark and cold. We continued on in the same fashion we had the other days, {% include tooltip.html text="pole pole" tip="slow slow" %}. As we ascended we left the alpine dessert and entered the 5th and final zone: the ice cap. The march up the mountain was cold, difficult, monotonous. We eat got into the rhythm of only focusing on the next step and then the next one after that. To stay warm we continuously moved up the mountain only taking quick breaks for water and tea. To help boost our spirts one of our guides, Hussein, and the porter submitting with us, John, sang to us as we walked. Katherine would get incredibly light-headed and nausceous, and she would periodically ask for a quick break. Even with the break to catch our breath, as the oxygen was at 50% of normal air, it was hard. 

About two thirds of the way up the sun finally broke the horizon line and started warming us up. It was one of my favorite sunrises. We got to the first ridge line and both were struggling incredibly with the altitude. With another hour to the summit, it still seemed like forever with tiny, tiny steps. We were confused with everyone coming down the mountain so quickly - many of them even running. How was it so hard for us to go up and so easy for them to go down?

Summitting was a blur and still feels something like a dream. After stopping for a few quick pictures and look around we headed down. Quickly learning that going down was much easier then going up. However not long after we started our descent. Katherine got altitude sickness and started vomiting. [tim don't know what katie wants to share about katherine's experience here]

![Katherine eating snow](/assets/images/2022-06-21-kilimanjaro/eat_snow.jpg)
{% include caption.html text="Although katie was sick she still managed to stop and eat some snow on the way down" %}

When we got to camp and our porters sang to us. Which was such a nice and special moment.[EXPAND ?ON THIS? video here?]

At camp we rested, recovered and had a hot lunch. This took a long time due to the sickness.  The guides wanted to get katherine as low as possible to deal with the altitude. However, by the time we were ready to leave we would not have gotten to the lower camp until after dark. We talked and agreed to due a shorter hike down to a higher camp and rest. This was so much the right call.

## Day 7 - High camp to Mweka Gate

| High Camp to Mweka Gate             |
|------------|------------------------|
| Elevation  | 3950 to 1640 m         |
| Distance   | 10 km                   |
| Zone       | Forest (#3) |

[ADD something about the experience tipping?]

We left high camp at the top of the heater zone. Passed through all the familiar plants that we had seen on the first two days. Our bodies were happy to have the increasing oxygen and moisture. From our time on the mountain our lips were chapped and noses unhappy. Our bodies didn't know what to do with all the moisture but we were happy. 

When we finally made it back to the parking lot we gave some information to our guide and got certificates printed with our names, ages, and when we submitted. 

We drove to town and ate lunch with the guides. We shared food for the first times with our guides and got to try [Ugali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugali) with chicken sauce and a liver sauce. It was by far the best food we had so far in Tanzania. Our only regret was not insisting that the rest of the team eat with us as well.

## Reflections

Our trip made a number of inequalities in the world very transparent to us. The team we were working with was happy to have work as many have had non since the beginning of the pandemic. And from that perspective we were happy to be spending our money on the experience. We were also happy with how the park was regulated. They ensured no porter is carrying more than 20kg with weighing station at the base and some of the campsites. The park also ensured that the porters had a tent to sleep in. Apparently in the past they would sleep out side or in caves.'

How ever it did feel strange to know skilled these people are and how little they are making dividing our trip cost across a week and 12 people does not amount to much. In addition this was not evenly slipt. There was a clear hierarchy among the team.

Overall, I happy we climbed kilimanjaro. I don't have a desire to do it a second time but it was a very unique experience. It is truly special to climb one of the tallest mountain in the world with little to no mountaineering experience our selves. For the inequities, I don't think they are any more or less then what we experience in the State but they are definitely more transparent
