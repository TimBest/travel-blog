Kilimanjaro was hard, for many reasons. That said, we are glad we hiked it.

## Day 0 (Getting to Tanzania)
We took a direct flight on a Boeing 777 from Amsterdam and landed at 8pm local time. With customs and the drive to our hotel, we didn't get into our room until just after midnight. At that point, we still needed to pack our bags and make sure that the rental equipment would work with our needs. With the bags, we also needed to create three: each of us with one bag to go up Kilimanjaro with our things, and a third to store at the hotel afterwards. When going through the gear we were renting, we quickly learned that our definition of a 'winter coat' differed from the rental company's (as they lived in a tropical climate). However, the top of Kilimanjaro is below freezing, so we chatted with them and and thankfully we were able to get them agree to bring all their 'winter coats' the next morning so we could layer a few coats ontop of one another to stay warm. All in all, we didn't get much sleep that night.

The next morning we awoke around 7 to eat breakfast and sort through our layers. When we walked out of the hotel we were greeted with a bus full of people - which completely surprised us. 16 in total! The driver, our coordinator, 2 guides, a waiter, a cook and 8 porters. We were quite taken a back with how many people there were to carry our things, as we are used to backpacking by ourselves or with a small group of friends (without porters or support staff). Where everyone is responsible for carrying their own things and the weight of the communal items (and our bags) was shared amongst the porters. With that we drove to the base of the mountain to start the hike! 

## Day 1

| Machame Gate to Machame Camp      |
|------------|----------------------|
| Elevation  | 1800 to 2835 m       |
| Distance   | 11 km                |
| Zone       | #2 Rain Forest       |

On the drive from our hotel to the gate our guides introduced themselves and started telling us about the mountain. Kilimanjaro consists of five ecological zones, from base to summit:

1. Cultivate (tropical areas that residents farm)
2. Rain forest
3. Heather moorland
4. Alpine dessert
5. Ice glacier

We drove through cultivated zone which was largely covered with banana farms. Arriving at the gate we entered the rain forest zone and set out on the first day of the Machame Route up the mountain. It was beautiful and reminded us both of Hawaii. We saw baboons eating food that other humans have dropped, many beautiful wild flowers, and a waterfall.

{% include caption.html text="The Elephants Trunk Flower - our favorite from the rain forest zone" %}

This first section of the hike was where we had the most autonomy. Our guides let us hike freely in order to get a sense of how fit we were to summit and how well we could pace ourselves. Of course, this was unbeknownst to us at the time. They were watching our hiking to gauge our strength and help inform the pace they would set for us for the remaining days. We also chatted with them and were truly bonded by the time we made it to camp. We also would regularly pass the cook and one of the porters, which was an indicator to us that we were going fast up the mountain on this day.

We reached camp about an hour before night fall. It was located right on the border between the rain forest and the heather moorland zones. The temperature was dropping quickly and Katherine's bag with all her layers had not yet arrived, as it was with a porter we had passed along the way. Without her layers, it was really hard for her to stay warm. This worried our guides and turned out to be a learning lesson for all. For the rest of the trip, it was made sure that our bags arrived at camp before us.

## Day 2

| Machame Camp to Shira Cave          |
|------------|------------------------|
| Elevation  | 2835 to 3750 m         |
| Distance   | 5 km                   |
| Zone       | Heather Moorland (#3)  |

The night and morning were colder than we were expecting this early on in the hike. We ate breakfast inside the large "dining tent", a large canvas tent brought specific for the "client" (us) to eat in. It was equipped with a lamp, table, two chairs, dinnerware and serving dishes. Even with all these luxury items, breakfast was hard. One of the strategies we use when camping in cold weather is to bring food we absolutely love. This is really beneficial since it can be difficult to keep an apetite when cold, and delicious food is always goes down easy. However, we were now halfway across the world and up a mountain with our food already planed and packed by someone else from an entirely different culture who was literally guessing about what we liked. Someone who was tasked with cooking western meals without access to western ingredients or pallette, and "western" ranging from Eastern European to US. It was humbling to watch this happen, given the effort they were putting in. That said, it was also challenging to find food we enjoyed.

After breakfast we finally got to meet the whole crew and everyone introduced themselves. We tried to make a point of learning everyone's names. While we did accomplish in the end, it difficult at first. Especially for the porters we did not interact with because they were more shy or did not speak any English.

The hike up to Shira Cave was beautiful. The heather moorland was less dense than the forest. However, still offered a wide variety of unique and interesting plants. Our guides were super knowledgeable about all the different plants and were able to answer all our questions. One of our favorite flowers we were introduced to was the Everlasting Flower. They came in a few different colors and shapes and were one of the few flowers blooming on the mountain. Including are the pink and yellow ones bellow. When touched, the petals felt almost like plastic.

We arrived at camp early in the afternoon, giving us some time to relax. The day had been hard for both of us, trying to catch our breathe while walking a solid ascent. When we got into the tent, Katherine was feeling defeated. We sat together and tears came to her, a release of emotion from the intensity of the day (this is co-authored, so we feel comfortable sharing this aspect of our experience). It was really hard, and we were glad we were together, to have the experience and to support one another.

Shira Cave campsite was a beautiful camp site. After decompressing, Katherine got some time to draw one of the trees from the moorland while I had a look around camp. One thing I noticed was how many bones there were in dried up water ways. In asking our guides I found out that it was common to cook beef with the bone in, and many cooks will toss the bones on the ground afterwards.

This campsite was also above the clouds and lead to some beautiful views of the night sky. We were able to see the Southern Cross, the Milky Way, many satellites and even a shooting star! This was the start of a collection of starry nights!

## Day 3

| Shira Cave to Lava Tower            |
|------------|------------------------|
| Elevation  | 3750 to 4600 m         |
| Distance   | 7 km                   |
| Zone       | Alpine Desert (#4)     |

| Lava Tower to Barranco              |
|------------|------------------------|
| Elevation  | 4600 to 3900 m         |
| Distance   | 3 km                   |
| Zone       | Heather Moorland (#3) |


![ice formation withing the dirt](/assets/images/2022-06-21-kilimanjaro/cool_ice.jpg)
{% include caption.html text="A cool ice formation we found in the first hour of our morning hike" %}

Day 3 was a day designed to acclimate us to the higher elevations. Our route brought us up almost 1000 meters (3,200 feet), exposing us to the altitude. Then it lead us back down almost to the elevation where we started, yet also bringing us closer to the summit on the route. This allowed us to sleep with more air and stay strong, yet introduce our bodies to less oxygen. It was a long and difficult day.
 
We left the heather zone and moved into the alpine dessert, which had far fewer plants. Despite this, it was still scattered with everlasting flowers. This day was a struggle for both of us and we felt the altitude with every step. This is when we learned {% include tooltip.html text="pole pole" tip="slow slow" %}, the slogan of the mountain meaning "slow slow." We walked in a single file line with one guide in the front and one in the back. The guide in the front set a slow pace for us and took us up the mountain one short step after another. Neither one of us had hiked at such a slow pace, a new experiment for us.

After reaching the first ridgeline on our way to Lava Tower, we found a spot out of the wind for lunch. There we were swarmed with many birds. They were bold. While they did not take any food out of our hands or lunch boxes, they did fly over and perch just a few inches from us. Forcing us to play an endless game of shooing them away as we ate with our hiking poles. It was actually a pretty funny interation. Later in lunch, Katherine started mimicking a hunting animal where she would let the bird get very close than make a loud noise and thrust her hand like she wanted to grab it. The few birds she did this with did leave, but there were many more to keep shoo-ing. 

We stopped again at Lava Tower for a quick break, some snacks and photos. The camp site was an interesting mix of folks planning to stay the night and larger groups whose team was making them a hot lunch to keep going toward the summit. We were glad we would be able to rest a bit. On our descent our guides we a bit shocked at how slow we both are going down. I think that given our age and fitness they were expecting us to go much faster when not having to work as hard going down. We shared that we both have knee injuries that prevent us from going down quickly, which brought surprise from our guides as we had been keeping a good pace to that point and seemed strong. Nonetheless, we practiced "pole pole" on the way down as well.

![Dendrosenecio kilimanjari](/assets/images/2022-06-21-kilimanjaro/25_trees.jpg)
{% include caption.html text="Dendrosenecio kilimanjari" %}

On the way down we also learned about [Dendrosenecio kilimanjari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrosenecio_kilimanjari) a giant groundsel found on Mount Kilimanjaro. Our guides told us two methods of telling their age. The first it to count the rings of dead leaves. Similar to tree rings each one of these rings is about a year. The other way is to count the number of times a trunk splits. At every 25 years, the plant will produce a flower and then create 2-4 new branches from that location. We started counting the age of all we saw from then on, like a fun game that we looked forward to.

## Day 4

| Barranco to Karanga                 |
|------------|------------------------|
| Elevation  | 3990 to 3995 m         |
| Distance   | 5 km                   |
| Zone       | Alpine Desert (#4)     |

We started out with the most technical part of all of Kilimanjaro. It included a little bit of scrambling up a rock wall with periodic drops directly next to the path. You were aware of the edge at all time and sometimes stepping over small gaps between rocks. I felt at home with all of my rock climbing adventures. Katherine has a slight fear of heights, so the guides worked with her to feel comfortable as we moved up the rock wall on the narrow path. While this was straight-forward for us, with daypacks and two guides, it was incredibly impressive for all the porters going on the same trail. Each were carrying 20 kilos (44 pounds) on either their head or back (based on their preferent. Many continued to balance their bags on theri heads while ascending. At the top of the wall, we got an amazing view of the snow-capped peak of Kilimanjaro. We took some photos here and just admired it. Additionally, we also had cell phone service - with Katherine's phone dinging with a text message (much to her surprise!) Many of the people we passed on this day were doing the same route we were but in 6 days instead. Where we stopped for camp was where they had lunch and continuing on to base camp getting there at 6 or 7 pm. They then slept for 3-4 hours, and would summit starting at midnight. Again, we were glad we were taking longer for this hike.

![Katherine licking salt off the rocks](/assets/images/2022-06-21-kilimanjaro/buffalo.jpg)
{% include caption.html text="Katherine practicing her buffalo impression" %}

As we were hiking, we noticed buffalo skulls and pockets of salt. Our guides told us that buffalo on the other side of the mountain would climb up to lick the salt that formed on the rocks. One even went into a small cave to lick the salt only to get stuck and die there. It was humbling to think of these animals doing the same ascent we were. 

We got to camp early, feeling pretty good. That night, with a clear night. Katherine and I watched the stars again, with her pointing out different constellations. We admired the Milky Way and looked for satellites and shooting stars. It was magical.

## Day 5

| Karanga to Barafu (Base Camp)       |
|------------|------------------------|
| Elevation  | 3990 to 4673 m         |
| Distance   | 4 km                   |
| Zone       | Alpine Desert (#4)     |

We had a very short hike up to Base Camp - where all the trails merge and everyone sleeps for a handful of hours before summitting. When we got there, we were able to enjoy a hot lunch and do a final check of the gear we would summit in. Along our route we had rotated around Mount Kilimanjaro's front and side. The view of the ice cap from Base Camp was breath taking. Base Camp is nestled in a low valley between Uhuru Peak and another hill to get to the [????] Peak seen nearby. While this nearby peak is not as tall, it is much more technical for climbing. With much admiration or porters and guides told us stories of how KG had formed the first route up the mountain, that it is some of the only technical climbing in Tanzania and that still to this day KG is the only person permitted to go up. 

We were also on a ledge, isolated part of the camp. We could see other routes' trails to base camp, along with the amazing terrain of the area. Given that we were tired, it was hard to breathe, and the temperature was downright cold, we huddled in the tent for almost the entire time we were there, napping and thinking of the trek that night. 

That night we went to bed as early as we could fall asleep wearing everything we would submit the mountain in: 5 layers of clothes on both top and bottom. We had rented our sleeping bags as to not carry our own all around Europe. Similar to the jackets, we ran into another differing definition. For us a 'winter' sleeping bag keeps you warm and is often most insulative when you are not wearing layers. For the ones we rented, the expectation is that you sleep in all of your layers to make up for the lack of insulative properties of the sleeping bag. It felt very different from what we are used to, and did us keep us a bit cold. Nonetheless, we did get a handful of hours of sleep.

## Day 6

| Barafu to Uhuru Peak                |
|------------|------------------------|
| Elevation  | 4673 to 5895 m         |
| Distance   | 5 km                   |
| Zone       | Ice cap (#5)           |

| Uhuru Peak to High Camp             |
|------------|------------------------|
| Elevation  | 5895 to 3950 m         |
| Distance   | 10.5 km                |
| Zone       | Heather Mooreland (#3) |


We were awoken at 11pm. We had a quick drink of tea/hot water and started our march up the mountain. When we left at 12 am (midnight), the moon still hadn't risen. It was dark and cold, below freezing. We continued on in the same fashion we had the other days, {% include tooltip.html text="pole pole" tip="slow slow" %}, taking exceptionally small steps in front of the other. However, this time, we did not talk. Our guides had warned that the oxygen level was so low that any extra effort, such as talking, would be quite hard for your body and hasten the time it would take for the journey to become uncomfortable. 

As we ascended we left the alpine dessert and entered the 5th and final zone: the Ice Cap. The march up the mountain was cold, difficult, and monotonous. We eat got into the rhythm of only focusing on the next step and then the next one after that. We were in a long line of headlamps, groups of humans trudging up the hill slowly. As we passed people, Katherine would say "Great job! Happy Summit Day!" with enthusiasm to every single group, being the cheerleader for the whole moutain. She did this from start to finish of the hike, even when she was feeling extremely sick herself. 

We both were tired, cold, feeling our fingers starting to get numb, and had headaches that just increased in their sharp intensity with the elevation. Every single person was in their own mental game of putting that one foot in front of the other, with just the light from our headlamp circles feeling real. 

It takes at least 6-7 hours to summit, meaning you are walking that whole time, slowly up the mountain, mostly in the dark. The guides also advised us against stopping for breaks, as they add up and you need to keep your body warm by moving. We took our first break at 2:30 am, and the guides were thrilled with our progress and focus on walking. As we ascended, we need more breaks because the oxygen level was dropping and it was impacting our bodies ability to keep walking. The top has about half of the oxygen you are used to. [For example, sea level air has 20.9% effective oxygen in the air for your body, whereas the summit of Kilimanjaro only has 10.1%, and Everast has 6.9%.](https://www.higherpeak.com/altitudechart.html#:~:text=Even%20at%20sea%20level%3F,acclimatize%20before%20you%20leave%20home.) This means you feel this sharp difference. Katherine was especially impacted by this, feeling nausceous and sometimes stumbling in her steps from the dizziness she had. When we did stop, breaks varied from 2-3 minutes to just allow us to catch a breathe, or up to 5-10 minutes to sit for a quick tea break.

To help boost our spirts, Hussein, one of our guides, and John, the porter summitting with us, sang to us at a break. One or two breaks later, it was clear that Katherine was really struggling with her nausea, headache, and dizziness. We had been hiking for about 5 hours at this point, so it was 5 am. She just sat there and cried, a release of the stress and intensity of the experience. I held her and rubbed her back, comforting her, until she calmed. After she cried, she just said "okay, let's keep going. I'm okay and feel better", trying to relieve the guides of their nervousness from watching her cry. She said she actually felt better from crying, as it allowed her body to reset. The guides also wanted to take her dayback, which was basically just her water, to reduce the weight. She insisted in both carrying her own pack and not having help in walking up (leaning on the arm of a guide.). She said "I want to do this myself with this backpack, otherwise summitting won't feel like I actually did it." Nonehtless, we kept going and Katherine carried her own backpack (and herself) the entire way up. 

To keep us distracted from our bodies being so physically uncomfortable, we asked the guides to sing to us in the last steep part of the hike after the break where Katherine cried. They were happy to do it, as they were used to the climate acclimation and walking well. We had about an hour and a half to get to a high plateau, Stella Point. 

About two thirds of the way up, before Stella Point, the sun finally broke the horizon line and started warming us up. It was one of my favorite sunrises. We got to the first ridge line and both were still struggling incredibly with the altitude. With another hour to the summit, it still seemed like forever with tiny, tiny steps. At this point, we started seeing people walking down the mountain. We were confused with everyone coming down the mountain so quickly - many of them even running. How was it so hard for us to go up and so easy for them to go down?

We sat at Stella Point and took in the view. It was a good 20-minute break and our guides were thrilled with the time we were making. It was 7 am, which meant that we were making good progress. 

We were an easy 45-minute walk from the summit, and the walk was a slight incline. However, at that moment, it felt like more steep upwards from how tired our bodies were. Stella Point is on the other side of the crater from the Uhuru Peak. Kilimanjaro is a volcano. Over its life, there have been three peaks created, with Uhuru being the newest and highest one. However, the volcano used to come to a point, and then the top bit collapsed in - creating a crater. This means that you get to Stella Point and then need to walk the rim of the crater to the peak, the highest point on the crater rim. 

We basically dragged ourselves up and trudged to the top at the slow slow pace. People coming down were saying "you are so close, great job!" At this point, we were just focused on getting there. Katherine felt like a robot, not even thinking or processing everything beyond moving her feet. Everything else was so uncomfortable and numb it just faded. 

Summitting was a blur and still feels something like a dream. We took a handful of photos, looked around, and ate some food. Then we started the process of walking down the way we came. Katherine immediately gave her backpack to the guides. With the adrenaline drained, she also realized she had a hard time walking. She walked up the the lead guide, Julius, and took his arm. 

The day before, Julius has explained that if we can't make it up on our own, he and Hussein would take our arms and help us walk up with us leaning on them. Katherine did this with first Julius, then Hussein, on the walk down. She leaned completely on Julius, relying on him for balance and pacing. Our group's goal became descending as fast as possible to get to a higher oxygen level in the air - which was naturally solve the altitude sickness Katherine was facing. 

While doing the hike down, we stopped and took breaks. Twice, Katherine vomitted from the altitude sickness. After the first time she was sick, she again cried. I would sit next to her, rubbing her back and holding her hair back, generally supporting her. We would sit hugging quietly for a couple of minutes as she calmed down. Then, of course, we got up and kept hiking down. We quickly learned that going down was much easier then going up, but it was still challenging given how sick Katherine was. 

On the hike down, we passed a collection of snow. Katherine has a tradition of eating the snow on high mountains she hiked. So, despite being sick and feeling terrible, she also stopped and ate the snow there! 

![Katherine eating snow](/assets/images/2022-06-21-kilimanjaro/eat_snow.jpg)
{% include caption.html text="Although Katie was sick she still managed to stop and eat some snow on the way down" %}

When we got to Base Camp, and sat at the sign, Katherine cried again with relief and just continuing to process the experience. We had made it back to base camp, and still had more hiking to go. 

"I summitted once, vomitted twice, and cried three times" is now how Katherine describes her experience, with joy and lightness. 

At camp, we headed to our campsite. When we arrived, the team surprised us with a song! After a long walk and getting sick and being overwhelmed, it was an amazing celebration of this journey we had made. It was such a nice and special moment. It reminded us to stop and reflect on what we had accomplished when we had been just persevering to get to the site. 

[EXPAND ?ON THIS? video here?]

At camp we rested, recovered and had a hot lunch. This took a long time due to the altitude sickness and upset stomack, with Tim eating a normal lunch and Katherine eating toast with peanut butter.  

At camp, we also had to make a decision of how much to hike down. We were scheduled to hike another 4 hours to a campsite closer to the base. However, there was a campsite an hour away, High Camp, that was at a higher elevation than the originally-planned camp. I advocated for the closer camp to give ourselves more time to rest, which ended up being the right decision for everyone. We all rested for 2.5 hours, then we packed up camp and headed to the next camp. 

The normal 1-hour hike took us about 2 hours with stops. Then everyone ate and slept, giving us a much-needed night of rest.

## Day 7 - High Camp to Mweka Gate

| High Camp to Mweka Gate             |
|------------|------------------------|
| Elevation  | 3950 to 1640 m         |
| Distance   | 10 km                   |
| Zone       | Forest (#3) |

We left High Camp at the top of the heather zone in the morning with everyone feeling a bit better. It was lovely to pass through all the familiar plants that we had seen on the first two days. On the way down, we continued to learn more about the mountain and the life of porters from our guides. We were walking down the most popular re-supply route for porters working with larger groups, where they brought rubbish down and food up. 

Honestly, it felt surreal to know that the experience was about to come to an end. We kept reflecting at how fast the whole thing was, and how unique it was. 

Our bodies were happy to have the increasing oxygen and moisture. Not only was the oxygen helping our heads, our skin had become incredibly dry from the lack of moisture in the air. From our time on the mountain our lips were chapped and noses unhappy. Our bodies did not know what to do with moisture, and our noses started running, but we were happy. 

When we finally made it back to the parking lot, the coordinator greeted us and congragulated us. We also gave our guides our legal names and ages to our guide. If you summit, the park gives certificates printed with your names, ages, and when we submitted (date and time). We are definitely getting these framed! 

We drove to Moshi, a nearby town, and ate lunch with the guides, Julius and Hussein. It was the first time we were sharing a breakfast or dinner with anyone. We did eat with them at lunch, often when we were taking a break from hiking and tired. For this meal, we were energized and chatty. We had been told about[Ugali](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugali), a local polenta/corn, and finally got to try it. The guides ordered Ugali with chicken sauce and a liver sauce, and we ordered fried chicken and fish. Almost immediately, we were all sharing the four dishes interchangably, like family. It was a truly special moment for us to celebrate with them and solidify the bond we had made. Beyond that, it was by far the best food we had so far in Tanzania. Our only regret was not insisting that the rest of the team eat with us as well!

## Reflections

Overall, we are both happy we climbed Kilimanjaro. I don't have a desire to do it a second time, but it was a very unique experience. I can't beleive how accessible the sumbit is. The guides and porters make it so that there is no mountaineering experiance need to climb one of the largest mountains in the world.

For Katherine, she felt empowered by knowing that she summitted through a deeply physically uncomfortable experience. Even when her body was so frustrated, she was able to keep going and do this hard thing. Plus she kept her spirits up and tried to be a supporter and cheerleader for others. Even at the camp, when she cried, immediately after she spoke to folks who had seen her cry and heading up the mountain and encouraged them. It was a good reminder of how powerful your focus and atitude is when facing a challenge.
