Packing was really hard. We needed to pack for everything from the italian Rivera to the dolomites to amsterdam to kilimanjaro to the Serengeti to the beech on Zanzibar. Each of these places had drastically different requirements. With temperatures from -7℃ (20℉) to 33℃ (92℉) and elevations from 0 to 5,895M (19,341ft). Additionally we were under the impression that this all had to be done with a 15kg (33lbs) weight limit for our flight from the Serengeti to Zanzibar. This was for our checked and carry on bag.

2 days before our trip we packed our backpacking bags with everything we might need. The next day we spent the entire day getting on and off the scale slowly pulling out duplicate items, city cloths and a number of things we really should have brought with us. We had also created a pile of things the we were would consume or throw out before boarding the plane. The pile included toothpaste, moisturizer, altitude pills, etc.

In the end it turned out the the flight had a 20kg (44lbs) limit that we were now way under. While we do regret not bring some things like an extra pare of shoes, a more supportive day pack, and a cotton sleeping shirt. The lighter weight made it easier to get around especially given our stay on Bonossola was a 1.3 kilometer walk with a 156 meter elevation gain
