## Pistachio Butter

Delicious!!! I bought this at a grocery store in Cortina d'Ampezzo to try something new. We were both happily surprised and had this on toast, in pistachio & jelly sandwiches and with a spoon. Turns out its tastiness may have to do with the fact that it is mostly sugar.

## Balsamic vinegar that sprays

I LOVE me some balsamic vinegar and olive oil. It is a perfect pairing for Caprese, dipping fresh bread, making a simple dressing, or enhancing a vegetable panini.

At home, I use this cute dispenser. As seen here in the top left. However, it has a fatal flaw where I often end up adding way to much balsamic vinegar. In the states, I have seen this issue fixed with plastic flow limiters. However, they still have the issue of leaving you with only a few drops of concentrated vinegar and many barren areas.

In our stays and restaurants, we found it common for balsamic vinegar to be served in a spray bottle. This is revolutionary. It allows you to get just the right amount of balsamic and allows you to have a concentrated amount by spraying close to your food or a perfectly even distribution when spraying at a distance

## San Carlo Lime and pink pepper chips

10/10 Amazing! Picked up a small bag at the Biennale and fell in love. I was so happy to be able to get a giant bag in Cortina d'Ampezzo. I may or may not have eaten them in one sitting (so much for Kilimanjaro training). Check them out at [sancarlo.com](https://www.sancarlo.com/)

## Tomato sauce

In Italy, we made almost all our breakfast, almost all of our lunches, and the majority of our dinners "at home". One thing we quickly realized was the high quality of food at the grocery store. For a few Euros, we were able to pick up fresh handmade pasta, an amazing sauce and some veggies.

Le Conserve della Nanna's sauce in particular was great. The sauce only consisted of 3 or 4 ingredients. Additionally, it was incredibly light. It tasted like garden fresh tomatoes that had only been simmered for 10-15 minutes. A stark contrast to the heavily roasted taste of tomato sauces found in the states

## Food umbrella

We found a food umbrella in a drawer at our stay in Bonassola. Having never seen it we were both very amused. It is so light, packs down so small and seems to be [pretty cheap too](https://www.amazon.com/food-umbrellas/s?k=food+umbrellas). Will be picking up a few of these when we are done traveling for future backyard BBQs and picnics.
