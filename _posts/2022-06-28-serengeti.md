The Serengeti: The Animals and Place (post #1)

Visiting the Serengeti feels like a dream. 

Beforehand, knowing we were going to “the Serengeti” felt like a dream: we were going to see the world’s first UNESCO World Heritage site, watch the largest big-mammal migration on the planet, and directly observe large, surreal animals in their habitat. During our time there, it felt like a dream: watching lions nap and elephants monitor their young when crossing the road. Now, two weeks post-safari on a plane back to New York, it is still surreal. And quite tangible.

The Serengeti is a special, sacred place for this planet – in my view. It has three habitats: the plains, the woodlands, and the XXX. Animals move through these areas freely, some preferring ones over the other, but having slightly different behaviors in each. It is also an exceptionally large area, which thousands and thousands of animals living there. Different species live in harmony and support one another in a delicate ecosystem. 

And the animals. We saw everything so many times over. Elephants, giraffes, lions, leopards, gazelle, impalas, zebras, wildebeests, hyenas, and hippos were essentially daily sightings. The whole thing felt like we were watching a National Geographic episode, it was surreal. 

We were there for 7 days, 6 nights, staying in 3 different areas. This meant that we saw a true diversity of animal behavior – not just “saw the animal, check” but really understanding what is normal and how these animals operate. Elephants are extremely destructive to trees, hesitant around humans, and incredibly polite (and empathetic) to one another. Lions sleep all the time, know they are at the top of the food chain and still weary of humans due to both past and current hunting, and are terrible parents. Hippos, however, are fantastic parents. More giraffes are gay than straight, and they just stare when humans are nearby. Zebras and wildebeests travel together because zebras have great eyesight and wildebeest have great smell – together being stronger to find predators. Different antelope species often graze together. Once a potential predator is spotted, the predator stops hunting to not expel the energy and fail. You look for leopards in trees by finding their dangling tail, and they are very solitary. And so many more facts that we now understand about the natural world of this special place. 

The impetuous was to see the Great Migration, where 1.4 million wildebeests and zebras move 1,000+ kilometers from the bottom of the Serengeti to Kenya following highly nutritious grass (and the rains). They march together in single file columns of animals, moving together into grazing areas, forming a huge blob, eating, then disseminating back into single-file columns. This happens in the middle of the “resident” animals living – elephants, giraffes, hippos and everyone else. Being in the Serengeti while this was going through the central areas was incredible. 

First, let me tell you a little about “safari” life. If you go to the Serengeti, you go with a guide who is the driver in your specially designed safari jeep. The top pops up for you to stand above the car and watch animals through binoculars, giving everyone a clear view while keeping you safe from wild animals. The car is closed with windows and doors – which helps to also give the animals a peace of mind, as they get scared when humans come out of vehicles (knowing we are dangerous). You essentially just drive around until your guide spots an animal or hears another guide share a finding on the radio. Then you go and watch the animal do whatever it is doing. You get tired or the animal moves out of view, and you go searching for another animal. You do this for 8 hours a day – either in one trip or split into two trip (early morning and later afternoon). It is exhilarating and exhausting. You are focused and curious, then you are bumping along the dirt roads looking for more, then you are focused. It’s hot and dry (for our season), there’s some wind and dust, and periodically tsetse flies. 

There’s also sensory overload of the environment. The plains and woods alike are amazing. They just keep going, into the horizon. The periodic acacia tree sticks out. And, in the dry season, it is all golden grasses. The sky is an intense brightness for 12 hours a day, at the equator with the length of the day consistent. 

Overall, it is beautiful and overwhelming. It’s the Serengeti. 

We saw everything. Below, I have a list of all the animals we saw on each day, and it is long. We had a good guide, named Honest, and were incredibly lucky. Every day we’d go out thinking “well, we’ve seen so much, so what would another day bring” and then we’d see several incredible and new things. On our last day, we had an 11 am flight and had been there for 6 full days. We went out for 3-4 hours in the morning and we saw a family of lions and cubs trying to re-group after a hot air balloon got close and spooked them – it was a completely different dynamic with new sounds and body language.

-----------------

The history of the area and the animals is also deeply tied to hunting and colonialism. For hunting, the language is still leftover from the past, as we would go on “game drives” to find animals, including looking for the ”big 5”, referring to the hardest 5 animals to kill and get their heads mounted. With colonialism, we were exclusively presented with European and American food in the wilderness of Tanzania and every hotel has porters to help with your bags – including your purse and day backpack. Beyond this, you only see foreigners in the Serengeti and they almost exclusively have Tanzanian guides. Of course, the Serengeti charges their own country folk about 30% of the cost as a foreigner for the entrance fee and you could camp instead of staying at a fancy hotel. However, this cost is still too steep for most Tanzanians to afford to see their own country’s gem. In fact, guides cannot afford to bring their own families into these areas because of the expense.
