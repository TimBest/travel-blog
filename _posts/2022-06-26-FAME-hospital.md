[The Rhino lodge](https://rhino.co.tz/) was on top of the Ngorongoro crater. At this altitude it got very cold at night. Often below freezing. To keep warm the room was equipped with a small wood stove which the lodge had provided an equally small basket of dried dung to burn in the stove (Thankfully there was no smell). This stove was capable of keeping the room in the mid 40s. So to be comfortable the bed had many think blankets. Going to sleep with these accommodations was rustic and overall the nights sleep was pleasant.

However, around 5 AM in the morning I awoke win a feverish sweat. I quickly dashed to the bathroom where by body got rid of everything in my system. From both ends. At the same time. I then very quickly got chills and curled back up underneath the many layers of blankets. I was convinced the I had gotten food poisoning and I would be feeling better in no time. 

By breakfast time, I was still under the allusion that I just needed needed a bit more rest. That if we were simple to delay our start. Then I would be well enough to do our planed hike to Empakaai Crater and sleep under the stars. Katherine, Benedict (our cook) and Honest (our guide) were less convinced. They correctly surmised that I would be in no physical state to do physical activity and probably needed to go to a clinic. Katherine relayed this information to me and I reluctantly agreed that if I still didn't feel better by noon then we would go to the doctors.

As the morning progressed the cycle of fever, releasing the contents of my body, chills and nap continued every 50 minutes. I was unable to keep down any water and was getting dehydrated. With each cycle I was feeling worse. When it was getting close to the time to go to the doctors. Katherine, helped me get out of bed, get dressed and ensured that I had some water in my system. Suffering from a migraine and vertigo I was not kind or grateful at the time.

Bundled up Katherine slowly walked my to the car. Where I sat in the front seat wrapped in the sleeping bag I had planed to use that night. The ~30 minute drive to the gate was agonizing. Each bump on the dirt road set my head spinning. It took my full concentration to keep the contents of my stomach inside my stomach.

At the gate I was able to use one of the public toilets and at this point was able to keep the water down. I was still feeling awful. And had asked to sit here for 10-15 minutes before continuing the drive. As I sat, many people were coming up to Honest and had some strong words. Which he later told us that they were demanding he take us to a hospital so I stopped making the park gate unappealing to others. Thankfully, Honest defended the decision and let me sit there to regain some of my strength. 

Back in the car we continued our drive. This time we were thankfully on paved roads. When we got to the hospital I was seen immediately. They had a triage area outside where a nurse recorded by height, weight and blood pressure. I then took a seating in the waiting area. Just a few seconds after sitting down, I was escorted to an exam room where I saw a doctor. I described my systems and he asked a few questions like, "How long I had been in Tanzania?", "What kind of water I was drinking" and "Had I recently been in a swimming pool?".

After the exam, he escorted me to the emergency room. They pumped me up with 2L of saline solution and took some samples for lab work

We waited until noon to see if my condition would improve but by that time I was still unable to keep down water and had become severely dehydrated. We scarped any hope of safari that day and drove to the hospital. Our guide knew of an american doctor who ran an amazing, FAME Hospital, near by in Karatu.

At the hospital they saw me very quickly with barely a 5 minute wait. The doctor asked a few questions and then tried to collect a blood sample from my hand but was unable to get enough blood for how dehydrated I had become. I got an IV and was pumped with over 1 liter of liquid meanwhile they were finally able to take a blood, urine and stool sample. All the test came back within 20minutes and everything looked good.

We walked out with some medication for my stomach and to help prevent more diarrhea. Overall the experience was unpleasant but bound to happen when traveling and we were happy that it happened close to a good hospital.
