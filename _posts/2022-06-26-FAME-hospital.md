The next day I awoke at 5 am with a nasty case of food poisoning. My body quickly got rid of everything inside. I was convinced that it would quickly pass and we would still be able to go on our hike and camp over night in the [!!!!!] crater. Katherine, our cook Benedict and our guide Honest were less convinced.  We waited until noon to see if my condition would improve but by that time I was still unable to keep down water and had become severely dehydrated. We scarped any hope of safari that day and drove to the hospital. Our guide knew of an american doctor who ran an amazing clinic [name of clinic here] near by in ????.

At the hospital they saw me very quickly with barely a 5 minute wait. The doctor asked a few questions and then tried to collect a blood sample from my hand but was unable to get enough blood for how dehydrated I had become. I got an IV and was pumped with over 1 liter of liquid meanwhile they were finally able to take a blood, urine and stool sample. All the test came back within 20minutes and everything looked good.

We walked out with some medication for my stomach and to help prevent more diarrhea. Overall the experience was unpleasant but bound to happen when traveling and we were happy that it happened close to a good hospital.
