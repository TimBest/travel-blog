title: "Amsterdam - Bike, Buses, and Trains!"
author: Tim Best

I lived for 4 years in mountain view CA with out a car. My main forms of transit were wlaking, biking and the public rail (Cailtrain and Bart). I tried my best to avoid getting into a car often putting up with long and unsafe transit options. The one thing that always frustrated me was the lack of belonging on a bike. 

I have often researched Americans obsession with the Stroad, first class pedestrian transit and first class bike transit. All of whihc always ends up using Amsterdam as the gold standard for these alternative ways of moving. So going to Amsterdam was somewhat of a pilgramiage for me

Happily the city did not disapoint. I marveled at the 
- sidewalks lined with bike which still had plenty of space for pedestrian.
- The raised and teckture walk ways that is for people instead of people stepping down into the road
- the multiple lane bike ways with dedicated turning lanes and curbs on either sides portecting the cycalists from cars, buses, trolly, and pedestrians
- the intersections with bikes stoping in front of cars ensureing visability
- the distinct lack of mixed bike and car lanes. including the dreaded intersections where the bike line blindly crosses over the turn lanes
over all I loved getting around the city. The dedicated lanes, clean public transit and short waits at all tranist options made exploring Amsterdam a pleasure and added up to a safe and quite experiance. I noticed a distinct lack of the axity and fear that other citys leave me with

One thing that I didn't expect going to the city was how many cars there still are. In all my research I had focused so much on the other forms of tranist design. This discovery is starting to reframe how I think about cars. It seems that city designed for cars and a city designed for humans are not mutally exclusive but the problem lies in designing a city where cars are always have the highest priority in design.
