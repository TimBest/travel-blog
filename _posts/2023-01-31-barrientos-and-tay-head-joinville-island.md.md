### Barrientos Island (1/31)

- we had lunch with the redhead girl, her mother and Massimo
  - we were sharing our travels
  - we mentioned that we had now been on all 7 continents and so had the girl
  - Massimo "corrected us" and was like 'well that was only an island you need to touch the mainland for it to count
  - she was completely defeated as her smile deflated
  - we jumped in saying it still counts

### Tay head island (1/31)

- had Massimo take a photo of us with the true south flag
  - we weren't sure if it was right side up or not
- we did a two-mile hike around the fur seals
- we saw 2 Weddell seals in the water at the furthest vista
- the Skuas were very interested in us and would often fly right above our heads
- Massimo told us not to touch the bones because they have anthrax
  - later sean pilled up a penguin skull to rearrange it for a better leading lines photo
