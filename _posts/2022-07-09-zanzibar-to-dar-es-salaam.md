Woke up at 4:30. Dadi and Diali made us mocha pot Expresso and toast with jam. They brought it to our room. Dadi drove us very quickly to the ferry. 

As we drove we watch the markets come to life, many men praying at temple, and parents taking their children to school.

Dadi dropped us off at the ticketing station. And it was packed. We farted accroos the street in chius walking directly in front of motor bikes and large trucks. Security guards usered us in the ticketing both. At the ticketing both we ordered tickets and needed our passports but I left mine in the card. The lady said it was fine and just took our name.

Back out side Dadi picked us up on our side of the street and there was a cart blocking the door. We squeezed by into the car after convincing Dadi to drive us the block more to the port and help us get Paka on the boat.

At the port he hired us a porter. Who helped us push and squeeze out way into the line. Which we need to hope a barrier directly into others elbows. In side the port was no less crazy. Our passports were check and luggage scanned all while bumping into others and fighting for every inch of space. 

At the boat the stage tried to take out luggage to store. However, Katherines quick thinking saved us as she refused all the staff. We went inside the boat to more chaos. The I side was air-conditioning on full blast and way to cold for Paka so the porter took us upstairs where we were able to snage four seats facing each other for us, Paka, and the luggage.

Once in our seats we paid the porter and showed him the cat. He was confused and thought the carrier was empty until we opened it and showed him how small she is.

We were the only white people on the boat and the only people with a pet. We were definitely a curiosity. With many stairs. A security guard taking the ferry home behind us, named joesah, struck up a conversation and we showed him Paka. He was very amused with the cat. He asked more about the cat and we explained that we got her in kendwa and that she had no mother. He lived in dar es salaam and was doing business in Zanzibar. We had a nice conversation about our plans. And he was concerned for us taking her on the flight but relieved when we explained our plans to take her to the vet and wait the appropriate time to fly

One the boat we quick updated our Todo with everything we needed from the vet as our adrenaline started to wain and our lack of sleep caught up with us. We ate the eggs Dadi and Diali made for use and Katherine took a nap.

This whole time Paka is incredibly trusting of us. She briefly cryed in the car and tried to claw/bite her way out of the cage. Then quickly became content and  slept the rest of the car ride, through the port and even on the boat. In the past two days she has really shown her trust  When removing ticks she was in pain as some of her hair pulled with the tick but immediately when we were done she curled back up on my lap and started purring. When bathing her she was uncomfortable as we removed another tick, some fleas and so much clumped depbri. When we finished she went right to Katherine burrowing in her armpit for the warmth. She knew that she was loved for and no longer alone. And for that she trusted us

Goodbye Zanzibar and hello Dat Es Salaam 

When the ferry arrived we waited for most of the passengers to disembark. To avoid the elbows. Looking around it was us and all the people with kids leaving last. Once at the port we were swarmed with offers for a taxi agreed to one. He ussured us through security and we were on our way to the clinic.

At the clinic we found out the Paka was an okay weight and a normal temperature but probably had worms. The doctor answer our million questions. Showed us how to administer the worm medicine and we scheduled a time to come back to treat her for fleas, get vaccinated and complete the travel paperwork.

The vet saw us so early that we had time to kill between when the visit ended and whe we could check into our AirBnb. The vet said that there was a larger cage in the back and that they could let paka out of her carrier their while we sat outside at a table. As we couldn't do much with all our bags and a cat

At this point I finally was able to eat my eggs. We met a local who ran the IT department at a near by university and was taking in his dogs for an upcoming move to spain with his wife.

Once it was time to check in we ordered a tuk tuk and got paka from the vet. We were able to ram the two of us, paka and all our bags in the tiny tuk tuk and took off. As we drove it was hard to miss how pissed paka was. It was the most mad we had ever seen her. she was so agressive bitieng and scratching at her carier. When we tried to sooth her she attched us with full force. we tooka breif stop at a pet store I wated with paka and our bags as Katie went in and got litter, a litter box, and some toys.

Whenwe got to the Airbnb the cleaning lady was still working. We had been upgraded to a 3 bedroom since the guest in the 1 bedroom we booked had extened their stay. We took paka out of her carier and noticed she was covered in poop. We got her cleaned up as she explored the apartment. In no time she was back to her self, cuttleing and playing with us. 

We were both exaushted messes but Katie managed to muster the energy to get us take out from and american cafe accroos the street. We both got a burger and it was the best food. 

Later paka found a cozy spot sitting onmy wool buff in the sun
