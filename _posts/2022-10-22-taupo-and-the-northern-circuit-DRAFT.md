## Taupo

Our first step was to get ready for the Tongariro Northern Circuit trek. I had some anxiety about how much we needed to accomplish in our timeframe. Having only 2 days to get everything we needed to head into the backcountry. To add to my anxiety the forecast was showing below-freezing temperatures at night, little to no visibility at the ridgeline, and a high probability of freezing rain with a chance of snow.

### Shopping for Gear

Thankfully, we were in the right place, at the right time of year. Taupo is a popular town for the outdoors with a reputation of being a base camp for mountain biking. Because of this, the town has numerous camping stores and outlets. And we went to them all! Katmandu, [Gordons](http://www.facebook.com/gordonstaupo), [Torpedo7](https://www.torpedo7.co.nz), Mammout Outlet, and MacPac! We even went to some non-camping stores as well.

Our first stop was at Torpedo7 where we were able to make the first pass at our necessities. A stove, gas, water filter, and wool base layers. Next, we went to Gordons, a ski shop where we were able to get winter coats. I was able to find a spider jacket that I was debating purchasing in Amsterdam
