After spending the night in {% include tooltip.html text= "Mto Wa Mbu" tip="mosquito river" %}. We had a long drive to get back on track with our planned itinerary. The drive was exciting! We driving on rough unpaved roads. We had the windows open to cool down and have a better view. However, we remained vigilant the whole drive to close the windows when approching an oncoming vehicle or going through a particularly dustly area.  took were driving on unpaved roads, fording rivers and hiding from the dust

Although the weather wasn't the best. We still had an enjoyable time walking to see the flamingo breeding grounds. On the way we looked at the birds, dried salt formations and wildabeast tracks. Then on the way back we saw a  giraffe 
Our highlights were walking to the flamingo breeding ground in the lake where we  seeing some giraffes near the hotel.

Our stay was nice and when Katherine and I walked in we both immediately fell in love with the bed spread. One thing I have learned from Katherine is to always ask and one piece of advise I had received from a katherine and a coworker was that when traveling if you see something you love buy it.

In the morning Katherine asked our guide to ask the hotel if we could buy the quilt and two pillows. Not believing her, The guide said he would ask where they bought it from so we could get our own. So instead Katherine asked on of the staff herself. They laughed and quickly said no. She ask if they could ask their manager and they did. Soon after the we were walking to our room with the same staff member to get the quilt and 2 pillow cases to purchase. 

I think the whole staff and our guide had never seen this type of interaction before and were amused and fascinated. I am sure they all will go home to tell their family's of the tourist the brought the quilt right off the bed. 


Lake Natron seemed like a stop that was quite different in the past but has changed a lot with the rising global temperature. The area was quite warm but in talking to the locals it is colder than it should have been during this time of year. In addition, it was also far windier. We experienced incredible winds that kicked up so much dust. It was unpleasant to be outside for any length of time.
