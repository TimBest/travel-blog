Lake Natron seemed like a stop that was quite different in the past but has changed a lot with the rising global temperature. The area was colder then it should have been during this time of year and had incredible winds that kicked up so much dust that it was unpleasant to be out side for any length of time. 

Our highlights were walking to the flamingo breeding ground in the lake, seeing some giraffes near the hotel observing the dried salt and wildebeest tracks in the lakes shore. 

Our stay was nice and when Katherine and I walked in we both immediately fell in love with the bed spread. One thing I have learned from Katherine is to always ask and one piece of advise I had received from a katherine and a coworker was that when traveling if you see something you love buy it.

In the morning Katherine asked our guide to ask the hotel if we could buy the quilt and two pillows. Not believing her, The guide said he would ask where they bought it from so we could get our own. So instead Katherine asked on of the staff herself. They laughed and quickly said no. She ask if they could ask their manager and they did. Soon after the we were walking to our room with the same staff member to get the quilt and 2 pillow cases to purchase. 

I think the whole staff and our guide had never seen this type of interaction before and were amused and fascinated. I am sure they all will go home to tell their family's of the tourist the brought the quilt right off the bed.
