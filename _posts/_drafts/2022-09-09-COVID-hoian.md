## 9/7

### first symtoms

- I awoke feeling fatigued
- I though I was just tired form all the travel and needed a day off
- I took the morning off to watch TV

### meeting up with katie

- Katie went out into Hoian to checkk out the tailors that she had researched
- In the evening I went out to meet up with her
- I met her at one of the tailors
- She introduced me to the ?Pakastaine? shop owner of the store the thebeautiful rug we saw yesterday
- he showed us the new shop he was building
- we walkked around a very active construction site with sparkks from some folkks welding
- we walked into one tailor to look for a suit for me.
- I askked for purple fabric and they only had one very shinny fabric
  - purple is my favoritecolor
  - andI figured I could always get a grey/blue/black suit in the states
  - but would never get a customed taylored pruple suit
  - so why not take advatage of the opertuninty

### dinner

- striking out on getting taylored clothes we walkked along the Thu BÃµn River and stoped at the [ The Hoianian- wine bar & restaurant ](https://goo.gl/maps/2r5LYtRQ9ZJFH6oq7) for dinner
  - we sat inside on the upper floor but before we got or food one of the tables on the balcony freed up and we were able to sit there
  - it was a beautiful view with a long armof redlanterns sartingfrom our balcony out streched over the street

### Kimmy's take 1

- After dinner on our walkk back we passed Kimmy Tailor (around 7pm)
- KKimmy's was one of the top Taylors Katie had research so we decided to pop in for a "quick look"
- We asked about the purple fabric
- And oneof the taylors was like "of course we have many purple fabrics. Lets go to the whare house"
- we walkked out the store, down the block, and turned on a tiny ally to a completely unmarked frieght entrance
- she opened the door and inside was a huge space with floor to ceiling bolts of fabric
- We then spent the next two hours looking through fabrics
- we went through the purples and foundone that I liked and look classy
- before going to the whare house I saw a green suit that looked cool
- katie convinced me to askabout the green fabrics as well
- they didn'thave the same color as the displaybut we did find one I liked
- after selecting the two suit fabrics we went back to the show room and looked at liners
- the "recomend" silk liners were all to dated styles then I wanted
- I had been dreaming of getting a taylored suit since watching the vietnam top gear special in College
- I wanted a liner that poped
- the taylors really wanted us to select a silkk linner but I insisted on seeing the cotten fabric book whichhad a wider range offabrics
- they warned me that it would wear out sooner. I didn't care figuring if I worethe suit enough for the liner to fail I will have gottenmy moneys worth :D
- Ipicked a number of contendors.
- I wastornfrom a suit that I would enjoy and was stylish vs living my topgear fanacy and havingthemostobnoxious liner possible
- in the end I decided on a liner forthe purplethat popedbut was a bit more elegant and a liner for the green suit that was a bit more fun and poped
- after picking the fabrics we then lookked at an Ipad with 2 dozen differnet suit patterns.
- I easily narrowed it down to about5 patterns kknowing that Iwanted a slim cut single breasted jacket. but between those cut it was very difficult to find the right one
- we adventually settled on one after viewing a few of themon the show room floor
- all in all the process took about 2 hours and after leaving a deposit I left with an appoint for my first fitting tomorrow at 1pm

### cermaics store

- one the way back we stoppedina super cute cermaicsstore that Iwantedto checkout thefirst day
- we bought two bowels we liked as suveniers and so we could eat cereal in somethingother than our emergancy tupperware that we purchased in cambodia during our extension
- wefound outthe store opened in ???
- the owner was super nice
