Last night we got to spend 2 hours with Nathan having a very stimulating conversation about life, Tanzania culture and history, etc. He is such a nice kid and has added so much to our experience here. Tonight Libby stopped by to say goodbye and brought us the baobab fruit that is put on Simba forehead in the lion king. An incredibly kind gesture that has helped add a connection to Tanzanian culture that we have been longing for.
