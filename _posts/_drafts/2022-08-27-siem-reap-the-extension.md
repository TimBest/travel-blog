We were planning on being in Vietnam for 6 weeks. When researching online we found out that the only online visa was a 30-day visa and to extend you needed to physically leave your passport at an immigration office for up to 2 weeks. Not keen on leaving our passports with a foreign government we instead opted to get a 90-day visa on arrival.

However, when we arrived at the airport Cambodia airlines informed us that we needed a signed waiver from the Vietnamese government to get a visa on arrival.
