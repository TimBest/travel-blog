## To the airport

When we booked our flight to Cambodia and it had an overnight layover in Singapore. At the time of booking Singapore was closed to tourists. So we booked a 12-hour stay in on of the hotels in the airport. Yes they have hotels in the airport!!! You don't even have to leave security or customs. Fast forward to when we arrive at SFO. As we were on our way to the airport Katie started googling about Singapore's lock down and realized they were open. She floated the idea of maybe we skip sleeping in the airport and go in to checkout the city. I was less excited about touring Singapore while jet lagged and said "Lets talk about it on the plane". As we had plenty of time to make up our minds on what to do

At SFO we got the final weights of our luggages and had a nice conversation with a man we met named Dane. He was even nice enough to send us a photo of our plane leaving!

## The night

On the plane we had two differing strategies on how to adjust to the time zone. My plan was to stay up all "night" and fall asleep at a normal sleeping time in the local time for Singapore. Katie on the other hand stayed up for awhile and then went to sleep when she was tired. To pass the time I watched the first two Lord of the Rings (In prep for New Zealand) and we both worked to finish up the blog posts for Tanzania.

When we arrived at the Airport I was temperately energized by how cool it was but mainly wanted to get to our room and sleep. Katie on the other hand wanted to go into Singapore at least for dinner. We eneded up deciding that I would stay at our hotel and she would go into the city. As we were checking in the hotel attendant informed us on how we could get in to Singapore, what we could do when there, and where we should have dinner. At this point I was exhausted but the {% include tooltip.html text="FOMO" tip="Fear Of Missing Out" %} led me to ralley and we both headed into the city.

## Chinatown

We checked into the [ST Signature Hotel](https://stsignature.com/). It was a completely automated checkin process where you scaned you passport via an app to get your room code.  We then went for a walk to get some food. We walked througha night market in chinatown and then ate indian food at the Boat Quay overlooking the Singapore river. On our way we admired the cities arcitecture, cleanlyness and high density of plants. There were full trees growing from balaconies multiple floors in the air!
