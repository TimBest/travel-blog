- the caretaker of the Airbnb was amazing and so nice. he didnt speak any english but went our of hiswayto makeour stay great
- the first morning we reagranged the wholeplace. the stay was beautifully decorated but we wanted the selfspace to make it feellike home.It made a huge differance
- we treated each day likke a saturday/sunday. developed a rutine of wakingup slowly, making breakfast, woring outand then going out for an activity
- katie ordered fromtheindianplace theGoga recomended and itwasamzing!!! go veganindian food
  - I was very thankful thatwe have been able to eat something that isntbeef. my expectations of how meat havy Chile is (informed frommytimeinarentina) were thankkfully not true

### 1/21

- the first day we walked to bicential park and learned why siestas are so important. it was so hot in the sun but we copied the locals and found a single shady treeto hid under andread
  - as we read I noticed aall the birds fly away as two raptors landed on a sculpture
  - once the rators left all the birdsflewbackto thier perch
- we ate at la hamburgisa. intenting to order take out we piced what we wanted at the host station and thenfound out they onlydo dine in. so we sat on the padio. as we waited we played hangman on the placemats andhadway tomuch fun doing so.
  - turns out 'spotted hyena' and 'scuba diving' and 'touching elephants' are great hangman words
    I was so surprised that they had a Jucy-lucy I had to orderit...it did not disappoint
- we watched the somebody feed phil episode andthen ate our way through sabntiago

### 1/22

- after our morningroutine katie took medown the ???? road to show mehow they had closed it down for theday. it waspacked with walkkers and bikers. there were also tons of people learning how to rollerblade
  - it was really cool to see friends or couples where one was teaching the others
  - the city felt alive with change and full of potential and quickly headed to a great place
  - it maes mewant to visit again in 5-10 years and see the change
- we then braved the metro and were super impressed with how well thesystemwas desinged and geekked out about how easy it was to navigate
- the subway cars ran on tires on concreat paths which was facinating
- we then made it tro the humns rights museam
- the english audio guide left a lot to be wanted so we used google translate on everything of intrest. we would quick snap a pic with the app and read the translationon our phones
- the museam was beautifully curated and moved usboth
- we quicly lost trackof time and were moved by thehorific acts by the previous government
- the museum gave us great context for the changewe saw in the people given how new the country was
- particularly the vote si/no vote was facinating. I can't imagine the curage it takes as a citizen to trust the vote and stand up against the govenment
- another thing that moved me where the seahourses. at one prison the only time the prisoners weren't blind folded wasin the shower where there was a brass drain plate with a sea hourse in it which they was a symbolin a ton of the hand made art
- I also apprchiated there explination of how important art is in free thinking and communicationof ideas. they really painted the artist as the onewho forced the governmentto change
- the museumalsogave us context forwhy street art is sowidly accepted. ...given theprivous governmenthorific treatment of artists

- when we entered the table onour right had some of the largest tomatoes I had ever seen
  - they were so beautiful
  - called pinkk tomatoes
  - they had a small harvest but if there was a larger one then we appaerntly would have gone home with one
- inside was stark grey and no art on the wall
- one side was floor to ceiling glass
- they got to watch the sun set on the mountains and a small plane life a glider into the air multiple times
- there was a traditional patagonina feast
- for each dish it would appear and all four of us would take out our phones to snap a picture before consuming
- it was so interesting hearing where each ingrediant came from
- the restraubnt was inthe top 50 inthe world
- the tasting menu is a secret but it was fun to get a few hints out of the staff and obsver which tables were ahead of us to see what they were getting
- id ifitwas thebest food I have ever had but defiinetly the most unique. I think every single dish had an ingredient native to chillie that I have never even heard of before
- there were a few tables trying out a new menu
- we were staring down there dishes whihcwere served by the head chef
- he adventuall came over to show us one of the ingrediants he was showing them and we had a really nice conversation with him
