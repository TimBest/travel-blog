In our original itinerary, we had no intention to stop in Dar Es Salaam. We are grateful that Paka brought us to the city. The experience of getting Paka ready to fly back to the US forced us outside of the tourist circuit and led us to a number of memorable experiences including:

- Getting to shop at a supermarket
  - Seeing the American section
- Walking back and forth from the vet every other day with Paka
  - Everyone was curious about the two white people walking by with a cat
  - The tuk-tuk drivers out front recognized us as the crazy people choosing to walk
- Meeting other pet owners at the vet
- Befriending the Airbnb host adult children
- Having conversations with multiple shop owners about our cat and their life
- Getting to try Baobab
- Shopping in a local fabric market
- riding around in a Tuk-tuk
- Shopping at local markets
- Going to a mall

While in Dar Es Salaam we both felt lethargic and like we were not accomplishing enough each day. It felt like we would do one thing and be exhausted. Looking back now I realize that we had done so much up to that point and that we were doing a lot. Caring for the kitten was a lot of work, we each had multiple firsts everyday, and there was a lot of stress involved in exporting a kitten. 

The responsibility was 100% on us. We talked at length about if we were making the right decision. What if Paka was turned around at the border? Is it worth the risk for a better life? Should we be spending our time and money in a more impactful way? etc.

The Paka project lead us to have many interesting conversations and meet many new people but also left us missing out on really getting to know Dar Es Salaam. With everything going on most of the hours of the day we spent inside our Airbnb. Either reading, watching TV, playing with Paka or doing a puzzle


## 7/9

Read about our first day in Dar Es Salaam in the [previous post](/2022/07/09/zanzibar-to-dar-es-salaam.html).

## 7/10 

- The previous day we found an amazing American cafe right across the street from us. We spent many a meal there. It was a nice slice of home that felt very comforting.
- Knowing that we were going to be here for a while we hit up a grocery store to stock a kitchen. Which led us to explore the international isle in Tanzania. Including the American section.
- Paka started developing a tune stain around her lips due to her stuffing her entire face into the food dish
- We checked out the Slipway finding an amazing book store and a leather bracelet that became Paka's favorite toy. Up to this point she was playing with rocks, a dried nut and dog toys
