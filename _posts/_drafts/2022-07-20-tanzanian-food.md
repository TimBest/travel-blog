One fascinating things from traveling to Tanzania after Italy was how accessible the food is. As a tourist in Italy you have to seek out food that isn't italian. As italian food is the default food served everywhere. Additionally, many sovinear shops are stocked with dried pasta, olive oil, balasmic vinigar, and other italian foods. This was true in the vennice airport where we had to walk through the italian foods section of a duty free store to get onto our plane out of the country.

In contrast, in Tanzania we needed to out in effort to learn about and aquire local food. We had numerous converstations with the hotel staff or our gudies that all went some thing like:

Us: "Is it possible to serve us Tanzanina food?"

Cook: "You don't want Tanzaninan food. I will make you western food"

Us: "No really, we would like Tanzaninan food. We have tried X, Y, and Z so far. Could you make us one of those?"
