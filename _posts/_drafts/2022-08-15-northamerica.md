## The General Plan - Places & People
As you may know, Tim and I are focused on visiting all seven continents during our trip. Including North America, one of the seven. We are also deeply familiar with North America, at least the USA since it is our home. So there was the original question of how to travel to it.

When planning this spring, we knew that we needed to be back for two weddings, both best friends of mine. This was the trip – get back for one July 14 wedding and another August 2 (or so). That was the plan literally until a week before we left. 

And then our beautiful plan started to evolve. (Stay flexible, right?!) My grandfather’s memorial was rescheduled for the weekend between the two original weddings. Then the first wedding got moved, freeing up time for us to hang out in Tanzania – but then having another event to come back to the US later in the Fall. Then my cousin got engaged and booked her venue the week after the second wedding. 

Suddenly we had two weddings and one memorial service – on back-to-back weekends. Then we adopted this adorable kitten Paka and stayed in Tanzania 10 days after our intended return date. We’d done the research for travel in Japan, which changed to the Indochina Peninsula (Vietnam and Cambodia). And suddenly we were on a tight schedule of arriving, transitioning Tim’s parents’ house (as new people and environment), unpacking, going to these events, repacking, and flying to Cambodia. All in less than a month. Sound crazy? It was!

What we ended up doing:
•	Friday: Arrive at night from Tanzania to NY
•	Saturday: Celebrate some 30th birthdays with good friends 
•	Sunday: Sit down
•	Monday - Thursday: Drive 2.5 hours to Tim’s parents’ house, introduce the cat to them, help her adjust in a new place, drive back to my parents’ house to pack for the Midwest
•	Friday: Fly to Minneapolis, MN
•	Saturday: Grandpa Tom’s Memorial Service in Minneapolis
•	Sunday – Tuesday: Hang out with Family
•	Friday - Sunday: Attend best friend’s wedding in Wisconsin
•	Monday – Thurs: Pack for cousin’s wedding and 4 months of travel, visit Paka and Tim’s parents to help with the transition (and help us adjust to traveling without her)
•	Friday – Sunday: Attend cousin’s wedding in Austin, TX
•	Monday: Quick layover in San Francisco
•	Tues: Fly to Cambodia
•	Wednesday: Got word that a family friend died on Tuesday night in California


It was hectic. Tim met 40+ people from my life between family and friends – he’s such a good trooper! It was fun and a whirlwind. There were so many people we were originally going to see before our schedule shifted and we acquired the kitten. A road trip was in the works, along with connecting with folks in SF, NY, and the Southwest. All that fell through in our hectic month. We are grateful for what we did, and I was incredibly glad to show Tim all my family in Minnesota – a second home for me. He got to meet family and friends that I had been telling him about for years. 

## A Family Friend's Passing
One bittersweet thing. When I moved to San Francisco in 2010 with AmeriCorps, my mom introduced me to Rich Juelis, a friend of hers from middle school. When I moved back in 2012, he would regularly get lunch with me to see how I was doing. We built a friendship and would always hang out when my mom was in town. Frankly, he felt like another uncle I could call if I needed anything. Once he even watched my car for a month when I was back East for the holidays! On my last night living in San Francisco in June 2019, my mom, Rich and I went out to dinner. We had an immense amount of fun and got quite drunk. It was all laughs for hours. 

Earlier this year Rich was diagnosed with Pancreatic Cancer. I found out before we were leaving in May and we planned to visit SF so I could say goodbye. When we weren’t going to do the full road trip, we built in the 48-hour layover in San Francisco to see him. He and I had been emailing about it and we were excited to reconnect, and for him to meet Tim. Unfortunately, he was too sick to see me. He passed away the following day, on Tuesday night, after we were in the air to Singapore. I’m actually writing this post from Cambodia on Aug 30, so I’ve had some time to process his death. I have lit several incense sticks in Buddhist temples in his name for his spirit. (He was Christian, and these are the places of worship and reflection here.) Nonetheless, he was a good human and will be missed by those he knew – including our family. 

## A Whirlwind
Our North American time had lots of celebration and remembering all built into a quick handful of weeks. All in all, it was two weddings and two life reflection/memorial moments. It felt like bookends, with a little new kitten thrown in the middle! It included some funny moments. Everyone taking photos with our little penguin Peggy. Family pitching us on eloping abroad – one uncle was really excited to attend our zoom wedding from Antarctica! (No, we are not going to have a zoom wedding, but appreciate the enthusiasm.) 

Nonetheless, it was an incredible and crazy and reflective month. It made me grateful for the constellation of support from friends and family that I have. And grateful for Tim, as he met so many new people. Grateful for Tim’s parents, who quickly agreed to take care of Paka for 6 months while we continue traveling. Grateful for my situation and the life I can lead, and the adventures I’ve chosen to tackle. Just generally grateful for exactly where I am now.
