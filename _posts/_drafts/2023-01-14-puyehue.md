- the 4 other people in line with us were out ofluck as well
- we went up and down the lineof rentalcarcompanies askingif anyof them had cars. non did but one guy said hekknew a guy in town
- 15 minutes later we weresigning aform to rent a car from him
- the interaction felt alittle skcetchy but he didhave someoffical carbon copy paper whichmade it feelalittlemorelegit
- we had origionally rented an automatic so wecould split thedriving andon the planeover katie aggreeed to drive since I still hadent eaten anything solid allday
