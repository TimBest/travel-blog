Due to our shorter than anticipate Visa in Vietnam. We needed somewhere to go before ariving in New Zealand. We considered spending more time in Seoul but wanted to check out more of south East Asia. With the added benifit of being nicer o n our budget. 

We were both feeling a bit traveled out and figured a stay on the beech would help. Katherine looked at all the best beeches and narrowed it down to Bali and the Philippines. While Bali was physically further away. It had few connections and some of the best diving in the world. 

We both independantly before we met had been wanting to get SCUBA certified. and have gotten the advise over and over again to get certified in a destination with good diving.

We consided it in Zanzibar but ended up not doing it because of me being sick and adopting Paka. So we figure why not do it now!!!

## Ariving
We arived in Bali in the evening, already dark out, and both starving. The only airline available had been a budget airline (VIeJet??). Which we didn't get a meal on. We got through customs and met up with our driver. Dropped our stuff off and went back to the airport for dinner and some snacks (amazing sasuka, smothies, banabread and dried apricots). 

After our quick bite we met up with our driver and began the 2.5hour drive to Amed. We drove throught the mountains all the way accross the island. Not getting to our stay until 10:30PM. A long and exhausing day.

The next day our goal was to recover and say hi to our dive instructor. We slept in and got breafast at our stay before walking the 10 minutes along the beech to the dive shop.(we had chossen this stay intentionally to be with in walking distance of the shop). We met Martin and Laura signed our waviors.

We then went to a mexican resraunt Laura recomended and met the owner Jhonoton. It was the best Mexican food we have had aboad o n our trip and mad us both feel a bit at home. we then  walked back home, napped, and got ready for the week of diving.
