[The Rhino lodge](https://rhino.co.tz/) was on top of the Ngorongoro crater. At this altitude it got very cold at night. Often below freezing. To keep warm the room was equipped with a small wood stove which the lodge had provided an equally small basket of dried dung to burn in the stove (Thankfully there was no smell). This stove was capable of keeping the room in the mid 40s. So to be comfortable the bed had many think blankets. Going to sleep with these accommodations was rustic and overall the nights sleep was pleasant.

However, around 5 AM in the morning I awoke win a feverish sweat. I quickly dashed to the bathroom where by body got rid of everything in my system. From both ends. At the same time. I then very quickly got chills and curled back up underneath the many layers of blankets. I was convinced the I had gotten food poisoning and I would be feeling better in no time. 

By breakfast time, I was still under the allusion that I just needed needed a bit more rest. That if we were simple to delay our start. Then I would be well enough to do our planed hike to Empakaai Crater and sleep under the stars. Katherine, Benedict (our cook) and Honest (our guide) were less convinced. They correctly surmised that I would be in no physical state to do physical activity and probably needed to go to a clinic. Katherine relayed this information to me and I reluctantly agreed that if I still didn't feel better by noon then we would go to the doctors.

As the morning progressed the cycle of fever, releasing the contents of my body, chills and nap continued every 50 minutes. I was unable to keep down any water and was getting dehydrated. With each cycle I was feeling worse. When it was getting close to the time to go to the doctors. Katherine, helped me get out of bed, get dressed and ensured that I had some water in my system. Suffering from a migraine and vertigo I was not kind or grateful at the time.

Bundled up Katherine slowly walked my to the car. Where I sat in the front seat wrapped in the sleeping bag I had planed to use that night. The ~30 minute drive to the gate was agonizing. Each bump on the dirt road set my head spinning. It took my full concentration to keep the contents of my stomach inside my stomach.

At the gate I was able to use one of the public toilets and at this point was able to keep the water down. I was still feeling awful. And had asked to sit here for 10-15 minutes before continuing the drive. As I sat, many people were coming up to Honest and had some strong words. Which he later told us that they were demanding he take us to a hospital so I stopped making the park gate unappealing to others. Thankfully, Honest defended the decision and let me sit there to regain some of my strength. 

Back in the car we continued our drive. This time we were thankfully on paved roads. When we got to [FAME hospital](famemedical.org) I was seen immediately. They had a triage area outside where a nurse recorded by height, weight and blood pressure. I then took a seating in the waiting area. Just a few seconds after sitting down, I was escorted to an exam room where I saw a doctor. I described my systems and he asked a few questions like, "How long I had been in Tanzania?", "What kind of water I was drinking" and "Had I recently been in a swimming pool?".

After the exam, he escorted me to the emergency room. They pumped me up with 2L of saline solution and took some samples for lab work. Less then hour later the results from the blood work, stool sample and urine sample came back. Everything looked good and my systems were from food poising. Nothing worse. At this point I was feeling much better. I was prescribed: Secnidazole, Cipofloxcin, Zinc, and Imodium. Which we were able to pick up at the pharmacy next to reception. Overall, this was one of the best hospital experiences and by far the fastest lab work turn around times. In addition to all of that they only charged me $150 USD. Which was the tourist price. They charge far less for local. We were happy to pay it for the care and happy to know that it will be spent doing a lot of good.

We then ate our packed lunch outside the hospital polio wing. Then headed to our newly booked hotel in {% include tooltip.html text="Mto Wa Mbu" tip="mosquito river" %}. Where Benedict cooked us the meal we were going to eat at our campsite after the hike. This meal had been the best food we had been served so far in Tanzania. I did the best I could to eat as much as I could with my limited apatite.

That evening we did some research into hospital and enjoyed reading about [FAME (the Foundation for African  Medicine & Education)](https://fameafrica.org/). We were particularly impressed with [the founder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-ud_cS6Mek), [there commitment to staffing the facility with Tanzanian nurses/doctors](https://fameafrica.org/famestaff), and their [community outreach](https://fameafrica.org/outreach) and [education](https://fameafrica.org/education) programs.
