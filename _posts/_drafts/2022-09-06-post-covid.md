Many of the hotel rooms we stay in havn't been used since pre-COVID. It seems that almost univerally hotel close there upper floors and opperate out of the rooms on the first or second floor. When visiting Hanoi they put us on the 4th floor. Katie asked if we could move to the 6th floor (the Highest one). They moved us and the room was dusty. I Siem Reap we asked for a higher floor and got a room that smelt a bit off. We are happy for the trade off of a little dirty for a better view. Espesially since we are staying for a few nights and house keeping is quick to clean the room.

Many of the guides we hire have been out of work for COVID. It has been heart breaking to hear how hard things have been. In Tanzania their entire economy is built on tourism. So everyone suffered. 

In Zanzibar we talked with a Taxi driver who was no longer able to give rides durin COVID. As the rate for a taxi by car is to expensive for the locals who seem to either take motor bike taxis. There also seems to be a small fraction that own thier own car or have a private driver. This taxi driver told us since COVID he is now trying to diversify his income with Taxi driving, selling goods in a shop, farming and raising chickens. But it is hard to do the other activites when he is taken away for hours to do the taxi. He then said how he would like to hire someone to run those activies but there are no loans available

We feel conflicted on one hand COVID has provide so much hardship on the other it has given us an amazing opertunity to see wonders of the world with so few people.

 On Kilimanjaro our guides pointed to a place where the edge of camp was pre-COVID and we then walked another kilometer to the center of camp where we setup our tents. 
 
 In Angkor Wat we were able to do a private photo shoot in the main door with less then a dozen people walking through in the time we were there. We have photos of us at the main door with no one in the background as if it was our private abode. This is mainly possible because China's borders are still closed. Looking back at videos from 2018-19 it is clear that the site used to be as packed as a concert. 
 
 In Siem reap a shop keep explained to us how COVID caused a brain drain and many of the people who worked in tourism moved to the capital Phomn Phen for work.
