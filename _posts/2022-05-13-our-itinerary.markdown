Today is the last day that either of us wil be in the work force for awhile. The pandemic
has robbed us of our adventures. Tim is turning 30. Katherine has wanderlust. We
are in our one-third-life-crisis stage, because why not?? We’ve decided to
travel the world instead. Before things like pets, house owning, and kids keep us
rooted. No regrets!

Here’s our itinerary:

- May 20th - Fly to Rome and explore Italy. Including Venice Biennale & Hiking in the Dolomites
- Mid June – Hiking Kilimanjaro (Tanzania)
- Late June - Going on a Safari to see the Great Migration of 800,000 Wildebeasts, Zebra, and more in Tanzania
- Mid July – Some beach days on Zanzibar (Tanzania)
- Mid July to Late August – Road trip between 2 weddings and 1 memorial in NY and WI (including Burlington, Montreal and other fun places TBD!)
- September to mid-Oct – Japan – Hiking, good food, cultural and historical sites
- Mid-Oct to mid-Dec – New Zealand – Backpacking and nature exploring galore!!!!! Including backpacking to Mount Doom (the Lord of the Rings trail)
- January – South America - possible Patagonia area. possible a trip into the amazon
- Late Jan – Antarctica
