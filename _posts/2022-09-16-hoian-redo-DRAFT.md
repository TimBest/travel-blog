Even though I was done with quarantine i was still feeling quite fatigued. We decided to cancel our plans to see the southern half of Vietnam. And stay place in Hoi An. We felt like there wzs still more to check out in the area but wanted to move away from the main/tourist down town strip. To do this we found a home stay X miles away. But this meant we had to find a way to get from where we were staying into town. So Katie rented a learned to ride a motor bike!

## Learning to ride a motor bike
- the guy dropped it off. Realizing Katie was a novice he offered to give her a lesson
- Tim's first time on any sort of gas power bike. Terrifying
- our home stay was on a small slightly paved road the ended with a steep incline up to a very buy "double yellow road"
  - Katie started walking this but over time worked up to going up and down the incline and merging with traffic without issue
  - I (Tim) learned not to back seat drive while white knuckling the back seat
- ran the motor bike into a light pole when trying to park. broke the headlight housing (we aid the guy we rented it from more than enough to fix it)

## Cooking class
- went on a tour of the market
  - bought a vietnamese peeler
  - got to see tons of fish
  - including a shark on the back of a motor bike
- got on a boat and went down the river
- arrived at a separate pavilion
- chef showed us how to make something and then we went to our cooking stations to make it and then we ate it was super fun and easy
