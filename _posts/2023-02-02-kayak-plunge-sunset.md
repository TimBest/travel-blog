### Kayaking (2/2)

- they set up a really efficient system
  - a platform was hung a few inches below the surface between two zodiacs
  - you climb over the first zodiac and slide off the edge onto the kayak where staff are standing to keep it stable
    Katie and I were struggling to balance the desire to record the experience and be present in it
- there was a thin layer of ice in a number of places that we got to kayak through and listen to the crunch
- there were three safety zodiacs running this way and that to make sure everyone was safe and stayed away from the icebergs and glaciers to avoid injury from calving
- we ended up being delinquent and stayed out in the kayaks for both the first group and the second group
  - skipping the walk around the shore to the waterfall

### Polar Plunge (2/2)

- toes went numb instantly
- Boonie tried to swim to the other zodiac and the dry suit guy had to jump in and pull her back
- standing in line was worse than the dip. the breeze every time they opened the door was freezing
- took a shot of patron with liz?&Kevin? after
- 4 of us sat in the hot tub then the sauna
  had a buffet-style lunch on the top deck

### penguin suits (2/2)

- all four of us wore the penguin suits to dinner
- did a lap around the dining hall giving the other guests their "penguin sitting for the day"
- went to the bridge and got our photo taken with the captain
- called ourselves the linbladius guestus penguins
  - added the linbladius guestus penguins to the bird sightings chart in the captain's bridge

### The most magnificent sunset (2/2)

- the purple icebergs
- red sea
- watched from our balcony
- T went to the bridge afterward and the captain, navigator and night shift guy was there
- the captain seemed a bit tense managing all of them and avoiding the ice
