We looked for flights from Austin to Siem Reap, Cambodia and the ones in our budget and on our timeline had a 1.5-hour layover in SFO. Having lived in the area we both knew that SF can be very fogging in August and SFO will always have delays. So instead, we broke up our flight to go to SF, spend some time enjoying our favorite things, and then head on to Cambodia. 

It is always nice to visit San Francisco. We both separately spent our 20s there and there are many aspects that still feel like home. Our highlights

### Being a tourist and visiting the [painted ladies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painted_ladies) with Dr. Speckles
